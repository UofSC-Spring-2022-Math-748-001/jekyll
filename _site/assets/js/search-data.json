Then the path algebra $RQ$ is the free $R$-module on the set of paths in $Q$ with multiplication given by path concatenation. For a particularly simple example, consider the following quiver . and use $Q$ to denote it also. Then we have four paths. The two arrows we will denote as $a$ and $b$ plus the length $0$ loops at the two nodes, $e_0$ and $e_1$. Thus \\(RQ = Re_0 \\oplus Ra \\oplus Rb \\oplus Re_1\\) and the nonzero products are \\(ae_0 = a = e_1a \\ , \\ be_0 = b = e_1b \\ , \\ e_0^2 = e_0 \\ , \\ e_1^2 = e_1.\\) . Let $M$ be a $RQ$-module. Let us repackage the information present in the $RQ$-module structure in terms of more familiar data. Note that \\(1 = e_0 + e_1\\) in $RQ$. So we can write \\(M = e_0 M \\oplus e_1 M.\\) For shorthand, set $M_i = e_i M$. Each $M_i$ is only an $R$-module. For each arrow $a$ in $Q$, action by $a$ gives a map \\(\\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)}\\) which is $R$-linear. So we have an assignment \\(M \\mapsto \\lbrace M_i, \\phi_a : M_{h(a)} \\to M_{t(a)} \\mid i \\in Q_0, a \\in Q_1 \\rbrace\\) This process is reversible. Given $(M_i, \\phi_a)$, we set \\(M = \\bigoplus_i M_i\\) and let $a$ act by $\\phi_a$ on $M$. Given a morphism $f : M \\to M^\\prime$ of $RQ$-modules, since $f(e_i M) = e_i f(M)$ we see we have induced maps $f_i : M_i \\to M_i^\\prime$. Since $f(am) = af(m)$, we see that \\(f_i \\circ \\phi_a = \\phi_a \\circ f_i\\) for any arrow $a$. This process is also reversible. Thus the data of $RQ$-modules and their morphisms is the same as collections of $R$-modules indexed by vertices with $R$-linear maps indexed by arrows of $Q$.

We will make this precise in a moment. | Take $R = S = k[x]$ and $P = k[y,z]$ with the bimodule structure given by $x \\mapsto y$ and $x \\mapsto z$. To compute $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-)$ we will write a presentation for $k[y,z]$ as a $k[x]$-module. As $k[x]$-module, $k[y,z]$ has a infinite basis given by $z^i$ for $0 \\leq i &lt; \\infty$. Since it is a free module, \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k[y,z],-) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_k(k[z],-).\\) We can specify the $k[x]$-module homomorphism by providing a $k$-linear map from $k[z]$.

A functor $F$ is essentially surjective if the induced map \\(F : \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal C \\to \\operatorname{Ob} \\mathcal D/ \\sim_{iso}\\) is surjective. In other words, every object of $\\mathcal D$ is isomorphic to an object in the image of $F$.

Note this is misleading. In general, $F^{-1}$ is only determined up to natural isomorphism. All these definitions are tied closely together by the following fundamental result. Theorem. $F$ is an equivalence if and only if it is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. Proof. Let’s first assume that $F$ is an equivalence. Let $\\nu : F^{-1} F \\to \\operatorname{Id}$ denote the natural isomorphism. We have the following diagram . and we want to check that $\\varphi$ is actually the identity function. Note that, since $\\nu_X$ and $\\nu_Y$ are isomorphisms themselves, the conjugation $\\nu_Y \\circ - \\circ \\nu_X^{-1}$ is a bijection. Since $\\nu$ is natural transformation, we know that . commutes. Thus, \\(\\varphi(f) = \\nu_Y \\circ F^{-1}F(f) \\circ \\nu^{-1}_X = f\\) So $F$ is injective and $F^{-1}$ is surjective. Reversing the roles of $F$ and $F^{-1}$, we see that both are bijective. Since $X \\cong FF^{-1}X$, $X$ is isomorphic to $F$ applied to $F^{-1}X$. Hence, $F$ is essentially surjective. Now assume that $F$ is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. For each $Y \\in \\mathcal D$, pick some $X \\in \\mathcal C$ and isomorphism $\\phi_Y : FX \\to Y$.

In $\\operatorname{Set}$, $\\prod_{i \\in I} X_i$ is the Cartesian product. In $\\operatorname{Mod-}R$, $\\prod_{i \\in I} M_i$ is the Cartesian product with component-wise addition and action of $R$.

Recall the (inverse) limit of a diagram of sets $X_i$ is \\(\\operatorname{lim}_I X_i := \\left\\lbrace x \\in \\prod_{i \\in I} X_i \\mid \\phi_{ij}(x_i) = x_j \\right\\rbrace\\) Using this, for a general $I$-diagram in $\\mathcal C$, we can consider \\(\\begin{aligned} FX := &amp; \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X,X_i) \\\\ Ff := &amp; \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(f,X_i) \\end{aligned}\\) . We already saw the construction of limits in $\\operatorname{Set}$. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ and $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the set-theoretic construction carries a natural structure of an $R$-module or an $R$-algebra. One particularly common diagram is . The limit over this diagram is called the fiber product or pullback of the diagram. One might think that we can always reduce to an “underlying set-theoretic” construction for representing objects. This is not always the case. Beyond the fact that functors do not need to be representable, the representing object is not necessarily induced from the construction when we are able to forget down to sets. The opposite category of commutative rings is equivalent a category of topological spaces with extra structure and the product in this category does not forget to the set-theoretic product. We can also consider functors $F : \\mathcal C \\to \\operatorname{Set}$ that are represented in the other slot: $h_X \\cong F$ for some $X \\in \\mathcal C$. Each of the functors described above as co version. | If we have an object (co-)representing the functor $FX = \\ast$, then it is called the initial object. | . For $\\operatorname{Set}$, the initial object is $\\empty$. For $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, it is $0$ again. Finally for $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the initial object is $R$ itself. | Given a collection of objects $X_i \\in \\mathcal C$ for $i \\in I$ we have \\(FX := \\prod_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X_i,X)\\) The object representing this functor is a called the coproduct of the $X_i$. It is often denoted by $\\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} X_i$. | . For $\\operatorname{Set}$, it is the disjoint union. For $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, it is the direct sum $\\bigoplus_i M_i$. For finite coproducts in $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the construction is the tensor product $\\bigotimes_R R_i$. Let’s take a moment to see why. For each $R_i$, we have a homomorphism \\(\\begin{aligned} \\ell_i : R_i &amp; \\to R_1 \\otimes_R \\cdots \\otimes_R R_s \\\\ r_i &amp; \\to 1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes r_i \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes 1 \\end{aligned}\\) Given $f : \\bigotimes_R R_i \\to S$, we get $f \\circ \\ell_i : R_i \\to S$. In the inverse direction, if we have $f_i : R_i \\to S$, we can set \\(f\\left( \\sum r_1 \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes r_s \\right) := \\sum f_1(r_1) \\cdots f(r_s)\\) . Infinite coproducts in $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$ also exist. It is the subring of the infinite tensor product generated by elementary tensors with all but finitely entries equal to $1$. | Given a poset $I$ and a diagram $I^{op} \\to \\mathcal C$ we can consider \\(FX := \\lim \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal C}(X_i,X)\\) which is represented by the colimit, when it exists. It is denoted by $\\operatorname{colim}_I X_i$. | . In $\\operatorname{Set}$, the colimit is given by the quotient \\(\\left( \\bigsqcup_{i \\in I} X_i \\right)/\\sim\\) where $\\phi_{ij}(x_j) \\sim x_i$. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, the colimit takes a similar form \\(\\bigoplus_i M_i / (\\phi_{ij}(m_j)-m_i).\\) . Finally, for $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the analogous formula works. Taking our diagram from from before and reversing the arrows (plus rotating a bit) ask us to fill in the missing node in the square . The resulting object is fiber coproduct or pushout of the diagram. In $R\\operatorname{-Alg}$, the pushout of . is given by the tensor product $S_1 \\otimes_T S_2$. ",

    "content": "Each morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$ in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ admits a kernel and cokernel. To characterize them via universal property, let us remember the following definitions. Definition. Let $\\delta_i : A_i \\to A_{i+1}$ be a collection of morphisms of abelian groups for $- N &lt; i &lt; M$ (with the possibility that $N = \\infty$ or $M = \\infty$). We say that $(A_\\bullet, \\delta_\\bullet)$ is a complex if \\(\\operatorname{im} \\delta_i \\subseteq \\ker \\delta_{i+1}\\) .

These definition are given for the moment in Ab but we will how to make sense of them in an arbitrary abelian category momentarily. With this, we note that $\\ker \\phi$, for $\\phi: M \\to N$ of $R$-modules, fits into the exact sequence of abelian groups: \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime, \\ker \\phi) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\prime,N)\\) . Similarly, for the cokernel $\\operatorname{cok} \\phi$, we get an exact sequence \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\operatorname{cok} \\phi, M^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(N,M^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,M^\\prime)\\) . Each of these is characterizations is equivalent to a universal lifting/extension property. For the kernel, we have the diagram . which expresses that we get a unique $\\tilde{\\psi}$ if and only if the composition $M^\\prime \\to M \\to N$ is $0$. In other words, we can lift map $\\phi : M^\\prime \\to M$ uniquely over $\\ker \\phi \\to M$ if and only if $\\phi \\circ \\psi = 0$. For the cokernel we have the dual lifting problem . which expresses that we get a unique $\\tilde{\\psi}$ if and if $M \\to N \\to M^\\prime$ is $0$. In a general additive category $\\mathcal A$, given $\\phi : X \\to Y$ we ask about representability of the functors \\(T \\mapsto \\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(T,X) \\overset{\\phi \\circ -}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(T,Y)\\right)\\) and \\(T \\mapsto \\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(Y,T) \\overset{- \\circ \\phi}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(X,T)\\right)\\) . If the first is representable, we call it the kernel $\\ker \\phi$. Note that there is natural transformation \\(\\ker\\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,X) \\overset{\\phi \\circ -}{\\to} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,Y)\\right) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,X)\\) given by forgeting that the map lies in the kernel. Thus we have a unique map $\\alpha : \\ker \\phi \\to X$ if the kernel exists. For the second, we call the representing object the cokernel and write it as $\\operatorname{coker} \\phi$. It comes with a natural map $\\beta: Y \\to \\operatorname{coker} \\phi$. Existence of kernels and cokernels is almost enough for the definition of an abelian category. There is one more condition that holds in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. For a morphism of modules $\\phi: M \\to N$, the natural map \\(\\operatorname{coker} \\alpha \\to \\operatorname{ker} \\beta\\) is an isomorphism. The first object is often called the coimage while the second is called the image of $\\phi$. In this case, both are isomorphic to the image $\\phi(M)$ submodule of $N$. In general, this is not assured. Definition. An abelian category is an additive category $\\mathcal A$ possessing all kernels and cokernels with the natural maps \\(\\operatorname{coker} \\alpha \\to \\operatorname{ker} \\beta\\) beings isomorphisms. Since the coimage and image coincide, we will just write this as $\\operatorname{im} \\phi$. Given this, we can talk about sub-objects and quotient-objects. A morphism $\\phi: X \\to Y$ exhibits $Y$ as a sub-object of $Y$ if $\\ker \\phi \\cong 0$. Similarly, $Y$ is a quotient object if $\\operatorname{coker} \\phi \\cong 0$. We will just write $X \\subseteq Y$ for a sub-object and $Y = X/Z$ for a quotient object. (Here $Z = \\ker \\phi$). We can now lift our definitions of complexes, exactness, and cohomology to an abelian category $\\mathcal A$ without altering any notation.

Exact sequences of the shape $0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0$ pop up frequently so they are given a name: a short exact sequence. By convention, a longer exact sequence is often termed long. Examples . | Of course the identity functor is exact. | The forgetful functor $\\operatorname{Mod} R \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$ is exact. | If $F$ is a free $R$-module, then $- \\otimes_R$ is exact.

We will see next that Hom and tensor are not exact in general. They are each “half-exact”. Adjoints and exactness . Given an adjunction $F \\vdash G$ of Ab-enriched functors between abelian categories, we get a some exactness for free. First, since $F$ commutes with coproducts and $G$ commutes with products, we automatically know that $F$ and $G$ are additive.

Let $\\mathcal A$ be a small abelian category. Then there exists a not-necessarily unital ring $R$ and a fully-faithful exact functor \\(\\mathcal A \\to \\operatorname{Mod} R.\\) . We will not provide a proof. See this MO post for a nice dicussion of the proof. The result becomes more immediate in examples where you already have a set of projective generators or injective co-generators in your hand. The hard work in the theorem is cook up an injective co-generator in a bigger category. The main utility of Freyd-Mitchell is that . | we feel good that $\\mathcal A$ is not so far from $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ and | each $\\mathcal A$ admits a faithful functor to $\\operatorname{Set}$ so we can reason using elements of each object $A$ of $\\mathcal A$. | .

This is almost tautological from the universal property of kernels. For a morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$, we know that \\(0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,\\ker \\phi) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,N)\\) is exact. In other words, we preserve kernels: \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,\\ker \\phi) \\cong \\ker \\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,M) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(T,N) \\right)\\) . The same argument in a general abelian category shows that $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(A,-)$ is left exact. Left exactness (in the opposite category) of   $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ . In the other entry, we get a functor $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$. The opposite category $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op}$ has the structure of abelian category where we exchange kernels and cokernels. From the universal property of cokernels we know that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\operatorname{coker} \\phi, T) \\cong \\ker \\left( \\operatorname{Hom}_R(N,T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,T) \\right)\\) Reversing the arrows, we see that $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ takes the kernels in $\\left( \\operatorname{Mod} R \\right)^{op}$ to kernels. Again, the same argument works in a general abelian category. Right exactness of   $- \\otimes_R M$ . Assume we have an exact sequence \\(M \\overset{\\mu}{\\to} N \\overset{\\nu}{\\to} C \\to 0\\) in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. Then $C \\cong M/N$. If we apply $- \\otimes_R T$ we get \\(M \\otimes_R T \\overset{\\mu \\otimes 1}{\\to} N \\otimes_R T \\overset{\\nu \\otimes 1}{\\to} C \\otimes_R T \\to 0\\) and we want to check exactness. We need to first check that each element of $C \\otimes_R T$ is in the image of $N \\otimes_R T$. Pick some element $\\sum c_i \\otimes t_i$. Since $N \\to C$ is surjective, we can find $n_i$ with $n_i \\mapsto c_i$ for each $i$. Then \\(\\sum n_i \\otimes t_i \\mapsto \\sum c_i \\otimes t_i.\\) . Assume we can construct a map $\\lambda: C \\otimes_R T \\to (M \\otimes_R T)/(N \\otimes_R T)$ making the diagram . where the arrows labelled with $=$ are the identity maps. Assume that we have some element $ x \\in N \\otimes_R T$ with $(\\nu \\otimes 1)(x) = 0$. Then, we also know that $\\pi(x) = 0$. So there exists a $y \\in M \\otimes_R T$ with $(\\mu \\otimes 1)(y) = x$ giving exactness at $N \\otimes_R T$. Now we turn to making $\\lambda$ using the universal property of tensor products. Consider \\(\\begin{aligned} C \\times T &amp; \\to (N \\otimes_R T)/(M \\otimes_R T) \\\\ (c,t) &amp; \\mapsto \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t} \\end{aligned}\\) where $\\tilde{c}$ is a choice of element of $N$ such that $\\nu(\\tilde{c}) = c$. We need to check this is well-defined and $R$-bilinear. Any other lift of $c$ is of the form $\\tilde{c} + n$ for some $n \\in N$. We have \\(\\overline{(\\tilde{c} + n) \\otimes t} = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t + n \\otimes t} = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t}.\\) Thus the function is well-defined. Since $\\tilde{c}r$ is a lift of $cr$, we see that we have an $R$-bilinear function. Thus, we get a unique $\\lambda : C \\otimes_R T \\to (N \\otimes_R T)/(M \\otimes_R T)$ with \\(\\lambda(c \\otimes t) = \\overline{\\tilde{c} \\otimes t}\\) This gives us the desired diagram and finishes the argument. Non-exactness . Consider $k[x]$ for $k$ a field. And write $k = k[x]/(x)$. We have an exact sequence \\(0 \\to k[x] \\overset{x}{\\to} k[x] \\to k \\to 0\\) If we apply $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(k,-)$ this turns into \\(0 \\to 0 \\to 0 \\to k \\to 0\\) which is not exact at $k$. Hence $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ is not right exact in general. If we apply $- \\otimes_{k[x]} k$ to our exact sequence instead we get \\(0 \\to k \\overset{0}{\\to} k \\to k \\to 0\\) which show that $- \\otimes_R M$ is not left exact in general. Similarly, if we apply $\\operatorname{Hom}_{k[x]}(-,k)$, we get \\(0 \\leftarrow k \\overset{0}{\\leftarrow} k \\leftarrow k \\leftarrow 0\\) which shows that $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ is not right exact in general.

    "content": "For what modules $M$ is $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,-)$ exact? $- \\otimes_R M$? $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(-,M)$ . Projectives . We already saw that if $F$ is free $R$-module then $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-)$ is exact. We can take one step away from this. Recall that $X$ is a retract of an object $Y$ in a category $\\mathcal C$ if there exists maps \\(\\begin{aligned} i : X &amp; \\to Y \\\\ \\pi : Y &amp; \\to X \\end{aligned}\\) with $\\pi \\circ i = 1_X$. If $P$ is a retract of $F$, then $\\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-)$ is exact also. Indeed, we have a retraction of functors \\(\\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\pi,-) : \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-) &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-) \\\\ \\operatorname{Hom}_R(i,-) : \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,-) &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_R(P,-) \\end{aligned}\\) so we only need to establish that retracts of exact complexes are again exact. We should promote chain complexes to a category by providing morphisms between chain complexes. A morphism $\\phi_\\bullet : (A_\\bullet, \\delta^A_\\bullet) \\to (B_\\bullet, \\delta^B_\\bullet)$ is a collection of morphisms $\\phi_i : A_i \\to B_i$ for which all squares . commute. Given an abelian category $\\mathcal A$, we denote the category of chain complexes by $Ch(\\mathcal A)$. Assume we have a retraction in $Ch(\\mathcal A)$. This translates into a commutative diagram of which we prune at bit . Given $a \\in A_{i+1}$ with $\\delta_{i+1} (a) = 0$, then its image $b$ in $B_{i+1}$ also satisfies $\\delta_{i+1}(b) = 0$. From exactness of $B_\\bullet$, there exists a $b^\\prime$ with $\\delta_i(b^\\prime) = b$. Applying the map to $A_\\bullet$ gives an element of $A_i$, $a^\\prime$, with $\\delta_i(a^\\prime) = a$. We can represent this “diagram chase” via the following picture: . Definition. A object $P$ of an abelian category is projective if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(P,-)$ is exact. Proposition. In $\\operatorname{Mod} R$, the projective objects are exactly the retracts of free modules. Proof. The above shows that in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ retracts of free modules are projective. Assume that $P$ is a projective object. There exists a surjection $F \\overset{\\pi}{\\to} P \\to 0$. We can lift the identity . which exhibits $P$ as a retract of $F$. This is satisfying statement: we have an explicit construction of all projective objects. As a consequence, we have enough projectives in $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. In an abelian category $\\mathcal A$, we say have enough projectives if for any objects $X$ there exists $P \\twoheadrightarrow X$ for some projective $P$. Let us also note that if $P_i$ are projective for $i \\in I$, then $\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} P_i$ is also projective in a general $\\mathcal A$. Since \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}\\left( \\bigoplus P_i, M \\right) \\cong \\prod \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(P_i, M)\\) and products of exact sequences remain exact. Injectives . Definition. In an abelian category, we call an object $I$ injective if $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(-,I)$ is exact. This is the extension problem . Let’s look at injective objects of $\\operatorname{Mod} R$. Assume that $I$ is an injective module. Then we have a more easily-verified extension problem. For any ideal $J \\leq R$, we know that we can extend over inclusions of ideals . This is enough to characterize injectives. Lemma. (Baer’s Criteria) If $I$ extends over any $J \\leq R$, then $I$ is injective. Proof. Assume we have the diagram . and form a partially order set \\(\\lbrace (M^\\prime, \\psi^\\prime) \\mid N \\subseteq M^\\prime \\subseteq M \\text{ and } \\psi^\\prime|_{N} = \\psi \\rbrace\\) We say $(M_1^\\prime, \\psi_1^\\prime) &lt; (M_2^\\prime, \\psi_2^\\prime)$ if $M_1^\\prime \\subseteq M_2^\\prime$ and $\\psi_2^\\prime|_{M_1^\\prime} = \\psi_1^\\prime$. Then we have a partially order set and we can form upper bounds for any chain by taking unions. By Zorn’s Lemma, we just need to check the maximal element is all of $M$. Assume not and let $m \\in M \\setminus M^\\prime$ for maximal $(M^\\prime, \\psi^\\prime)$. Let \\(J := Rm \\cap M^\\prime \\leq R/\\operatorname{Ann}(m)\\) If $J = 0$, we can extend the map by setting $\\psi^\\prime(m) = 0$. Otherwise, let $\\tilde{J} = \\pi^{-1}(J)$ for the projection $\\pi: R \\to R/\\operatorname{Ann}(m)$. It suffices to solve the extension problem . By assumption we can do exactly this. Using this we can get some injectives in $\\operatorname{Ab} = \\operatorname{Mod} \\mathbb{Z}$. Any ideal in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $(m)$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, to extend . we need to find a $x \\in I$ with $mx = \\psi(m)$. In other words, we need to divide $x$ by $m$. We can always do this for $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ - giving two injective modules. Using $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ and some tricks, we demonstrate that $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ has enough injectives. Definition. An abelian category $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives if for any object $X$ there exists $X \\hookrightarrow I$ with $I$ injective. Proposition. $\\operatorname{Mod} R$ has enough injectives. Proof. Let \\(I := \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(R,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) . Note that, by tensor-Hom adjunction, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,I) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(M,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) Since \\(M \\mapsto \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(M,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) is exact, we see that $I$ is injective. One can check that for any abelian group $A$ \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) = 0\\) Pick some $0 \\neq a \\in A$ and then $\\mathbb{Z}a = \\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$. \\(\\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) &amp; = \\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z} \\neq 0 \\\\\\ \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) &amp; = (\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})_m \\neq 0 \\end{aligned}\\) where $(-)_m$ is the $m$-torsion. (Note here is where $\\mathbb{Q}$ doesn’t work.) We have a map \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) \\twoheadrightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(\\mathbb{Z}a,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z})\\) since $\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ is injective. Thus, $\\operatorname{Hom}_\\mathbb{Z}(A,\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$. Set $M^\\vee := \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M,I)$. Since $I$ is naturally a $R$-bimodule, $M^\\vee$ remains a $R$-module. We claim the map \\(M \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) is injective. If $M \\neq 0$, we know that $M^\\vee \\neq 0$. If we take the kernel $K$ of $M \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}$, then \\(K^{\\vee\\vee} \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) as $I$ is injective. But $K \\to M^{\\vee\\vee}$ is the zero map. Thus $K \\to K^{\\vee\\vee}$ must also be $0$. This implies that $K^\\vee = 0$. Since otherwise, there would be an element $k \\in K$ and nonzero function $\\phi:K \\to I$ with $\\phi(k) \\neq 0$. Thus \\(M \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee}\\) . To finish, we choose $F \\twoheadrightarrow M^\\vee$ for a free module $F \\cong R^{\\oplus X}$. Then, we get \\(M \\hookrightarrow M^{\\vee\\vee} = \\operatorname{Hom}_R(M^\\vee, I) \\hookrightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}_R(F,I) \\cong \\prod_X I\\) and note that if $I_j$ for $j \\in J$ are injective then so is $\\prod_J I_J$. Flat modules . Definition. An $R$-module $M$ is called flat if $- \\otimes_R M$ is exact. We have seen that free modules are flat. Similar to the argument above, retracts of free modules are also flat. Thus, projective modules are flat. But in general flat modules are projective. Consider the localization $k[x]_x$ as a $k[x]$-module. This is flat as localization is an exact functor. However it is not projective since any map $k[x]_x \\to k[x]$ must send $1$ to $p \\in k[x]$ which satisfies $x^iq_i = p$ for some $q_i$ any $i \\geq 0$. The only choice for $p$ is $0$. There exists a criteria analogous to Baer’s for flatness. Proposition. $M$ is flat if and only if \\(J \\otimes_R M \\hookrightarrow R \\otimes_R M \\cong M\\) for any ideal $J \\leq R$. We omit the proof. ",

    "title": "The homotopy category of chain complexes",
    "content": "The essential complication of managing quasi-isomorphisms is that being a quasi-isomorphism is not a functorial notion. It cannot be expressed via some diagram. We introduce a related notion that is functorial: homotopy. Definition. A homotopy $h$ between two chain maps $f,g: C \\to D$ is a collection of maps in $\\mathcal A$ \\(h^i : C^i \\to D^{i-1}\\) satisfying \\(f^i - g^i = h^{i+1} \\delta^i_C + \\delta_D^{i-1} h^i\\) for all $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We say $f$ and $g$ are homotopic. A morphism is null-homotopic if it is homotopic to $0$. A chain complex $C$ is null-homotopic if $1_C$ is null-homotopic. You can visualize the homotopy identities as saying the sum of thick paths in the diagram . equals $f^i-g^i$. Lemma. Homotopy is an equivalence relation. Moreover, it is a two-sided ideal. Proof. (Expand to view) For reflexivity, we can take $h^i = 0$. For symmetry, we can replace $h^i$ by $-h^i$. For transitivity, we can add the homotopies. For the ideal condition, if $f$ and $g$ are homotopic via homotopy and $u$ is a chain map then $u \\circ h$ is a homotopy between $u \\circ f$ and $u \\circ g$. Similarly, $h \\circ u$ is a homotopy between $f \\circ u$ and $g \\circ u$. &#9632; . Lemma. Homotopic maps induce equal maps on homology. Proof. (Expand to view) If $$ f^i - g^i = h^{i+1} \\delta^i_C + \\delta_D^{i-1} h^i $$ and $\\delta^i_C c = 0$ then, $$ f^i(c) - g^i(c) = \\delta_D^{i-1} h^i(c) $$ meaning that $$ \\overline{f^i(c)} = \\overline{g^i(c)} \\in H^i(D). $$ &#9632; . As a corollary null-homotopic complexes are acyclic, $H^i(C) = 0$ for all $i$. Definition. The homotopy category $K(\\mathcal A)$ has the same objects as $Ch(\\mathcal A)$ but the morphism spaces are \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(C,D) := \\operatorname{Hom}_{Ch(\\mathcal A)}(C,D)/\\text{homotopy}\\) . This is well-defined and comes with quotient functor $\\pi : Ch(\\mathcal A) \\to K(\\mathcal A)$ which is the identity on the objects and the quotient by the submodule of null-homotopic on morphism spaces. There is useful enhancement of the morphism spaces we can consider. For two complexes $C$ and $D$, let \\(\\operatorname{Hom}^l(C,D) := \\prod_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal A}(C^i,D^{i+l})\\) Equip these abelian groups with the structure of chain complex where \\((\\delta \\phi)^j := \\delta_D^{j+l} \\phi^j - (-1)^l \\phi^{j+1} \\delta_C^j\\) for $\\phi \\in \\operatorname{Hom}^l(C,D)$.

For any object $T$ of $\\mathcal T$, the functor $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(T,-)$ is homological and $\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal T}(-,T)$ is cohomological. Proof. (Expand to view) We treat the first case. Since any triangle is a complex, we already know that $$ \\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,Y) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,Z) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,X[1]) \\to \\cdots $$ is also a complex. Assume that $\\beta f = 0$ for some $f: T \\to Y$. Then, we can complete the diagram giving a $g$ with $\\alpha g = f$. &#9632; . Definition. A candidate triangle is a diagram \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) such that either \\(\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,Y) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,Z) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(T,X[1]) \\to \\cdots\\) is an exact sequence for all $T$ or \\(\\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(X[1],T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(Z,T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(Y,T) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(X,T) \\to \\cdots\\) is an exact sequence for all $T$. A useful lemma in detecting triangles is the following. Lemma. Assume we have a map of candidate triangles . with all maps labeled by $\\sim$ isomorphisms. Then $Z \\to Z^\\prime$ is an isomorphism. In particular, if at least one of the candidate triangles is an actual triangle, so is the other. Proof. (Expand to view) We assume that applying $\\operatorname{Hom}(T,-)$ to our candidate triangle yields an exact sequence. We apply $\\operatorname{Hom}(T,-)$ to the whole diagram giving From the five lemma, we have an isomorphism $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(-,Z^\\prime) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(-,Z) $$ and hence by Yoneda $Z^\\prime \\cong Z$. Thus, we have an isomorphism between our triangle and candidate triangle. By TR1), the candidate triangle is triangle. &#9632; . Note that the previous lemma applies in the case both rows are triangles. In particular, it implies that the object $Z$ completing the triangle for $f: X \\to Y$ is unique up to isomorphism. Definition. In a triangle \\(X \\overset{f}{\\to} Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) we call $Z$ the cone of the morphism $f$. Lemma. A retract of a triangle is also a triangle. Proof. (Expand to view) Assume we have a diagram Applying $\\operatorname{Hom}(T,-)$ gives a retract of an exact sequence which is also exact. Now complete $f: X^\\prime \\to Y^\\prime$ to a triangle: $$ X^\\prime \\to Y^\\prime \\to \\bar{Z} \\to X^\\prime[1] $$ We can complete the square and compose to get a map By the previous lemma, we have a triangle. &#9632; . We can play a similar strategy with other functorial constructions that preserve exact sequences. Lemma. Let \\(X_i \\to Y_i \\to Z_i \\to X_i[1]\\) be triangles for $i \\in I$. | If \\(\\bigoplus_I X_i \\to \\bigoplus_I Y_i \\to \\bigoplus_I Z_i \\to \\bigoplus_I X_i[1]\\) exists, it is a triangle. | If \\(\\prod_I X_i \\to \\prod_I Y_i \\to \\prod_I Z_i \\to \\prod_I X_i[1]\\) exists, it is a triangle. | . Proof. (Expand to view) We treat $\\bigoplus$ since $\\prod$ follows analogously. Take a triangle $$ \\bigoplus X_i \\to \\bigoplus Y_i \\to Z \\to \\bigoplus X_i[1] $$ Note that the possibile ambiguity in writing $\\bigoplus X_i[1]$ is fine since $[1]$, as an autoequivalence commutes with coproducts. For each $i$ we have a map of triangles which gives a map The top row is a candidate triangle as products of exact sequences of abelian groups remain exact. Applying the previous lemma shows it is a triangle. &#9632; . Finally, we can detect isomorphisms using objects via triangles. Lemma. The map $f : X \\to Y$ is an isomorphism in $\\mathcal T$ if and only if \\(X \\overset{f}{\\to} Y \\to 0 \\to X[1]\\) is a triangle. Proof. (Expand to view) For the forward direction assume $f$ is an isomorphism. Then we can construct a morphism of triangles showing $Z \\cong 0$. In the other direction, we can apply $\\operatorname{Hom}(T,-)$ and conclude that $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(-,f) : \\operatorname{Hom}(-,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(-,Y) $$ is an isomorphism.

    "content": "For $K(\\mathcal A)$ we already have the shift $[1]$. We just need to the collection of triangles. Definition. Given a chain map $\\phi : A \\to B$, the cone of $\\phi$ is the complex \\(C(\\phi)^i = A^{i+1} \\oplus B^i, \\ \\delta^i_{C(\\phi)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\delta_A^{i+1} &amp; 0 \\\\ \\phi_{i+1} &amp; \\delta_B^i \\end{pmatrix}\\) There are chain maps given by inclusion \\(B \\to C(\\phi)\\) and by projection \\(C(\\phi) \\to A\\) . The triangles will be diagrams isomorphic to a triangle for the form \\(A \\overset{\\phi}{\\to} B \\to C(\\phi) \\to A[1]\\) for some $\\phi : A \\to B$. Proposition. The homotopy category $K(\\mathcal A)$ with $[1]$ and these triangles is a triangulated category. One important fact to notice: this cone construction is a functorial. Given a square . we have a map of cones \\(\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\beta \\end{pmatrix} : C(f) \\to C(g)\\) . For a general triangulated category, this is not the case. Next, let’s check (some of) the axioms in order of convenience. TR1) Clearly $C(1_A) \\neq 0$ but we only need it to be null-homotopic. The map \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} : A_{i+1} \\oplus A_i \\to A_i \\oplus A_{i-1}\\) provides the null-homotopy. The other two conditions here are automatic from the definition of the set of triangle: . | Any map $\\phi : A \\to B$ can be completed to the triangle \\(A \\to B \\to C(\\phi) \\to A[1]\\) | Anything isomorphic to a triangle is itself a triangle as we declared that the set of triangles to be closed under isomorphism as part of the definition. | . TR3) We already mentioned the functoriality of the cone construction. Thus given a commutative square . we can complete it to a map of triangles . TR2) This reduces to the claim that $C(C(\\phi) \\to A[1])$ is homotopic to $B[1]$ and that $C(B \\to C(\\phi))$ is homotopic to $A[1]$. We expand on the later claim. The projection defines a chain map \\(\\rho : C(B \\to C(\\phi)) \\to A[1].\\) The map in the other direction is \\(\\ell : \\begin{pmatrix} \\phi &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} A[1] \\to C(B \\to C(\\phi)).\\) . The composition $\\rho \\ell$ is $1_{A[1]}$. The other composition is homotopic to the identity via \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} : C(B \\to C(\\phi)) \\to C(B \\to C(\\phi))\\) . Checking the other claim boils down to producing such homotopies similar to some of the following observations that relate the abelian category structure of $Ch(\\mathcal A)$ to cones. Proposition. | The sequence \\(0 \\to B \\to C(\\phi) \\to A \\to 0\\) is an exact sequence of complexes. | Let $K = \\ker \\phi$ and $C = \\operatorname{cok} \\phi$.

    "content": "The following definition comes from Spaltenstein though he attributes it to Bernstein. Definition. A complex $P$ is called K-projective if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,A) = 0\\) for any acyclic complex $A$. Let K-Proj be the full subcategory of $K(\\mathcal A)$ consisting of K-projective objects. A complex $I$ is called K-injective if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(A,I) = 0\\) for any acyclic complex $A$.Let K-Inj be the full subcategory of $K(\\mathcal A)$ consisting of K-injective objects. A simple but very useful observation is the following. Proposition. If $P$ is K-projective and $\\phi: A \\to B$ is a quasi-isomorphism, then \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,\\phi) : \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,B)\\) is an isomorphism. Similarly, if $I$ is K-injective, then $\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(\\phi,I)$ is an isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) We have an exact sequence $$ \\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,CC(\\phi)[-1]) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,B) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,CC(\\phi)[-1]) \\to \\cdots $$ with $$ \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,C(\\phi)[-1]) = \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P,CC(\\phi)) = 0 $$ since $C(\\phi)$ is acyclic. The case for $I$ is completely analogous. &#9632; . Definition. A full subcategory $\\mathcal S$ of a triangulated $\\mathcal T$ is a triangulated subcategory if . | Given any object $S$ of $\\mathcal S$, $S[1]$ and $S[-1]$ are also objects of $\\mathcal S$. | Given any map $f : S \\to S^\\prime$, then the cone over $f$ is also an object of $S$. | . Lemma. Both K-Proj and K-Inj are triangulated subcategories. Proof. (Expand to view) We have $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(P[i],A) = \\operatorname{Hom}(P,A[-i]) = 0 $$ since $A[-i]$ is also acyclic if $A$ is. Given a map $P \\to Q$, we complete it to a triangle $$ P \\to Q \\to C \\to P[1] $$ and apply $\\operatorname{Hom}(-,A)$ to get a exact sequence $$ \\cdots \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(Q,A) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(C,A) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(P[1],A) \\leftarrow \\cdots $$ with $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(Q,A) = \\operatorname{Hom}(P[1],A) = 0. $$ So $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(C,A) = 0. $$ The argument for K-Inj is entirely analogous. We will handle closure under finite direct sums below. &#9632; . Moreover, each is closed under larger operations. Lemma. K-Proj is closed under coproducts. K-Inj is closed under products. Proof. (Expand to view) For coproducts take in $K(\\mathcal A)$ this clear: $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(\\bigoplus P_i, A) \\cong \\prod \\opertorname{Hom}(P_i,A) $$ It is straightforward to check that coproducts in $Ch(\\mathal A)$ are also coproducts in $K(\\mathcal A)$. K-Inj works similarly. &#9632; . Lemma Both K-Proj and K-Inj are closed under retracts. Proof. (Expand to view) Given a retract $Q \\to P \\to Q$, we have a retract $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(Q,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(P,A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(Q,A) $$ of $0$ for acyclic $A$ and similarly for K-Inj. &#9632; . We can construct some K-projective/K-injective objects. Lemma. An object $P$ of $\\mathcal A$ is projective if and only if $P[0]$ is K-projective. An object $I$ of $\\mathcal A$ is injective if and only if $I[0]$ is K-injective. Proof. (Expand to view) We treat the case of $P$. Note that a chain map is equivalent to a map $P \\to \\ker \\delta_A^i$. If $H^i(A) = 0$, then lifting over $$ A^{i-1} \\twoheadrightarrow \\ker \\delta_A^i $$ is equivalent to constructing a homotopy of our original map. &#9632; . We can now build out bounded complexes. But first we want to recall two different ways to truncate complexes. Definition. The stupid truncations of $C$ are given by \\((\\sigma_{\\leq i} C)^j = \\begin{cases} C^j &amp; j \\leq i \\\\ 0 &amp; j &gt; i \\end{cases}\\) and \\((\\sigma_{\\geq i} C)^j = \\begin{cases} C^j &amp; j \\geq i \\\\ 0 &amp; j &lt; i \\end{cases}\\) . The other truncations (not really smart but less dumb) are \\((\\tau_{\\leq i} C)^j = \\begin{cases} C^j &amp; j &lt; i \\\\ \\operatorname{ker} \\delta_C^i &amp; j = i \\\\ 0 &amp; j &gt; i \\end{cases}\\) and \\((\\tau_{\\geq i} C)^j = \\begin{cases} C^j &amp; j &gt; i \\\\ \\operatorname{cok} \\delta_C^{i-1} &amp; j = i \\\\ 0 &amp; j &lt; i \\end{cases}\\) . Corollary. Any bounded complex of projectives is K-projective. Any bounded complex of injectives is K-injective. Proof. (Expand to view) We proceed by induction on the length of the complex. The case of length is covered above. We have an isomorphism $$ \\sigma_{\\leq i} P = C(P^i[i+1] \\to \\sigma_{\\leq i+1} P) $$ for the morphism given by kinking $\\sigma_{\\geq i} P$. Using the fact that K-Proj is closed under cones and shifts, we know that $\\sigma_{\\geq i} P$ is K-projective is $P$ is projective and $\\sigma_{\\geq i+1} P$ are. As always, the argument for K-injectives is similar. &#9632; . We can got a bit further in each direction separately. Lemma. A bounded above complex of projectives is K-projective. A bounded below complex of injectives is K-injective. Proof. (Expand to view) Given a bounded below complex of projectives $P$, the complex $P$ is the colimit over its truncations $$ \\sigma{\\geq i} P \\to \\sigma{\\geq i-1} P $$ If acyclicity were closed under limits, we would be done quickly. However, this is not the case in general. We do have a quasi-isomorphism $$ C \\left( \\bigoplus \\sigma_{\\geq i} P \\to \\bigoplus \\sigma_{\\geq i} P \\right) \\to P $$ and as part of homework you will check directly that any quasi-isomorphism between bounded above complexes of projectives is invertible up to homotopy. Injectives are handled similarly. &#9632; . You might hope that we can remove the one-sided boundedness conditions that remain. That is not the case. Example. Let $R = k[x]/(x^2)$. Then the infinite complex \\(P := \\cdots \\overset{x}{\\to} R \\overset{x}{\\to} R \\overset{x}{\\to} \\cdots\\) is not K-projective. If it were, since it is acyclic, it would have to be null-homotopic. In particular, for any other additive functor $F: \\operatorname{Mod} R \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$, $F(P)$ would be acyclic. But applying $- \\otimes_R k$ yields \\(\\cdots \\overset{0}{\\to} k \\overset{0}{\\to} k \\overset{0}{\\to} \\cdots\\) which is not acyclic. It is useful to note that any null-homotopic complex is both K-projective and K-injective so K-projectives do not need to have projective components. Even with the difficulties, we can translate having enough projectives/injectives into K-projective/K-injective resolutions. Proposition. If $\\mathcal A$ has enough projectives, then for all $C \\in Ch^-(\\mathcal A)$ there exists a bounded below complex of projectives $P$ and a quasi-isomorphism \\(\\phi: P \\to C\\) . Similarly, $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives, then for all $C \\in Ch^+(\\mathcal A)$ there exists a bounded above complex of injectives $I$ and a quasi-isomorphism \\(\\phi: C \\to I\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Via induction we can reduce to assuming that we have a commutative diagram such that $$ H^j(\\phi) : H^j(P) \\to H^i(C) $$ is an isomorphism for $j &gt; i$ and a surjection for $j = i$. The goal is extending $P$ and $\\phi$ to $P^{i-1}$ and $\\phi^{i-1}$ so that $H^j(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism for $j \\geq i$ and a surjection for $j = i-1$. Choose a $P_1 \\twoheadrightarrow \\ker H^i(\\phi) \\subset P^i$. Let $d : P_1 \\to P^i$ denote the composition. Note $P_1 \\to \\operatorname{im} \\delta_C^{i-1}$. So we can lift To get $\\phi^{i-1} : P_1 \\to C^{i-1}$ Now take a $P_2 \\twoheadrightarrow H^{i-1}(C)$ which we can lift which gives a map $P_2 \\to C^{i-1}$. Finally set $P^{i-1} = P_1 \\oplus P_2$ and $\\delta^{i-1}_P = 0 \\oplus d$ and let $\\phi^{i-1}$ be the induced map $P^{i-1} \\to C^{i-1}$. From the choice of $P_1$, we know that $H^i(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism and from the choice of $P_2$ we know that $H^{i-1}(\\phi)$ is surjective. You can guess how injectives are handled by now. &#9632; . We say that K-projective $P$ with a quasi-isomorphism \\(P \\to C\\) is a resolution of $C$ and similarly for K-injective. Next we treat resolutions of unbounded complexes. Proposition. Assume that $\\mathcal A$ has enough projectives and countable coproducts. Then, any $C \\in Ch(\\mathcal A)$ has a K-projective resolution. Assume that $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives and countable products. Then any $C$ has a K-injective resolution. Proof. (Expand to view) The complex $C$ is the colimit of the (not dumb) truncations $$ \\tau_{\\leq i} C \\to \\tau_{\\leq i + 1} C $$ We can choose resolutions $P_i \\to \\tau_{\\geq i C}$. Since the cone over $P_{i+1} \\to \\tau_{\\leq i+1} C$ is acyclic, we can lift $P_i \\to \\tau_{\\leq i} C \\to \\tau_{\\leq i+1} C$ to $P_i \\to P_{i+1}$. Now take the cone $C\\left(\\bigoplus P_i \\to \\bigoplus P_i \\right)$. This is quasi-isomorphic to the cone $C\\left(\\bigoplus \\tau_{\\geq i} C \\to \\bigoplus \\tau_{\\geq i}C \\right)$ which is quasi-isomorphic to $C$ since $$ 0 \\to \\bigoplus \\tau_{\\geq i} C \\to \\bigoplus \\tau_{\\geq i} C \\to C \\to 0 $$ is exact. The case of K-injective resolutions is handled analogously. &#9632; . ",

Since $C$ is acyclic and $P$ is K-projective, the map $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(P,P_A) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(P,P_B) $$ is an isomorphism for all $P$. Thus, so is $\\tilde{f} : P_A \\to P_B$. Now if $f$ is a quasi-isomorphism and $r_B \\tilde{f} = f r_A$ with $r_A,r_B$ also quasi-isomorphisms, then $$ H^i(\\tilde{f}) = H^i(r_B)^{-1} H^i(f) H^i(r_A) $$ is also an isomorphism for all $i$. &#9632; . Thus $Q : Ch(\\mathcal A) \\to D(\\mathcal A)$, given by the composition of the two functors, takes quasi-isomorphism to isomorphisms. Finally, we can check that $Q : Ch(\\mathcal A) \\to D(\\mathcal A)$ satisfies the universal property. Given $F: Ch(\\mathcal A) \\to \\mathcal C$ that takes quasi-isomorphisms to isomorphisms, it descends to $K(\\mathcal A) \\to \\mathcal C$. We can restrict it to the subcategory K-Proj to get \\(\\overline{F} : \\text{K-Proj} \\to \\mathcal C\\) And \\(\\overline{F}Q (A) = F(P_A) \\overset{F(r_A)}{\\to} F(A)\\) is a natural isomorphism. Thus, whenever we can find a K-projective resolution $P_A \\to A$ for all $A$ in $Ch^\\ast(\\mathcal A)$, we can use the full subcategory of the homotopy category consisting of those K-projectives quasi-isomorphic to a complex from $Ch^\\ast(\\mathcal A)$ as a model for the derived category. The case of K-injectives works completely analogously. ",

Thus, there is a natural isomorphism \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(\\mathcal A)}(A,B) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(P_A,B)\\) . Similarly, given a K-injective resolution $B \\to I_B$, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(\\mathcal A)}(A,B) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(A,I_B).\\) . The upshot of this observation is that \\operatorname{Hom}{K(\\mathcal A)}(P_A,B)\\(or\\)\\operatorname{Hom}{K(\\mathcal A)}(A,I_B)$$ is much easier to compute than the morphisms in the Ore-localized category. The main part of the work is finding a resolution that is amenable to computation. While this is definitely still a very serious task in general, it is managable in many examples. Example. Let $S$ be a commutative ring and $f_1,\\ldots,f_c \\in S$. Then Koszul complex on $f_1,\\ldots,f_c$ is the complex $K(f_1,\\ldots,f_c)$ with \\(K(f_1,\\ldots,f_c)^j := \\bigwedge^j S^{\\oplus c}\\) and whose differential is given by contraction $\\iota_{\\phi_f}$ with \\(\\begin{aligned} \\phi_f : S^{\\oplus c} &amp; \\to S \\\\ e_i &amp; \\mapsto f_i \\end{aligned}\\) for the standard basis $e_i$ of $S^{\\oplus c}$. In general, we get a map $K(f_1,\\ldots,f_c) \\to S/(f_1,\\ldots,f_c)$ but it not a resolution. Let’s look at a special case where we can check by hand that it is. Take $S = k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ with $k$ a field of characteristic zero and $f_1,\\ldots,f_n = x_1,\\ldots,x_n$. We can show that $\\rho : K(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\to k$ is a quasi-isomorphism. First note that we can split the map $\\ell : k \\to K(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ but only as a $k$-module. Then the homotopy \\(h = \\sum_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} e_i \\wedge -\\) shows that $\\ell \\circ \\rho$ is homotopic to the identity. ",

    "content": "We have a way to derive an additive functor $F : \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ between abelian categories. If we have enough K-injectives, then the right derived functor is \\(\\mathbf{R}F(X) := F(I_X)\\) where $X \\to I_X$ is a quasi-isomorphism with $I_X$ K-injective. Similarly, if we have enough K-projectives, then the left derived functor is \\(\\mathbf{L}F(X) := F(P_X)\\) where $P_X \\to X$ is a quasi-isomorphism with $P_X$ K-projective. These provide method, at least theoretically, to compute the derived functors: . | Figure out an explicit resolution | Apply $F$ | Compute homology. | . However, as with most mathematical objects, it is also desirable to have an abstract characterization of derived functors. Definition. An additive functor $F: \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal S$ is called exact if there is a natural isomorphism \\(F \\circ [1] \\cong [1] \\circ F\\) and for any triangle \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) in $\\mathcal T$ we have a triangle \\(FX \\to FY \\to FZ \\to FX[1]\\) in $\\mathcal S$. Any addivite functor $F: \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ extends to an exact functor \\(F : K(\\mathcal A) \\to K(\\mathcal B)\\) since it takes cone complexes to cone complexes. We would like to descend $F$ to an exact functor between the derived categories but there is only possible if $F$ was already exact as functor between the abelian categories. Instead, we take the “closest” exact functor to $F$ in a precise way. Historically, there exists (at least) two specifications for derived functors. Definition. (Verdier) The right derived functor of an additive functor $F: \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ is an exact functor \\(\\mathbf{R}F: D(\\mathcal A) \\to D(\\mathcal B)\\) together with a natural transformation \\(j_{\\mathcal B} \\circ F \\to \\mathbf{R}F \\circ j_{\\mathcal B}\\) such that for any other exact functor \\(G : D(\\mathcal A) \\to D(\\mathcal B)\\) and natural transformation \\(j_{\\mathcal B} \\circ F \\to G \\circ j_{\\mathcal B}\\) there exists a unique natural transformation $\\mathbf{R}F \\to G$ making the diagram . There is also a corresponding left derived functor. Here \\(\\begin{aligned} j_{\\mathcal A} : \\mathcal A &amp; \\to D(\\mathcal A) \\\\ A &amp; \\mapsto A[0] \\end{aligned}\\) is the fully-faithful embedding. Thus, we can view Verdier’s definition of $\\mathbf{R}F$ as the “closest” extension of $F$ to a quasi-isomorphism preserving functor. Another definition, due to Deligne, has the advantage of formulating the existence $\\mathbf{R}F(X)$ as a representability problem. Like most representability problems, if we make our category bigger we can solve it. Fix an object $X$ and note that the class of quasi-isomorphism $X \\to X^\\prime$ is filtered since we can complete . Definition. (Deligne) Let $X$ be an object of $D(\\mathcal A)$ then $\\mathbf{R}F(X)$ is the object of $D(\\mathcal B)$ that represents \\(Y \\mapsto \\operatorname{colim}_{X \\underset{q.i}{\\to} X^\\prime} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal D(\\mathcal B)}(Y, FX^\\prime )\\) . If Deligne’s $\\mathbf{R}F$ exists, it satisfies Verdier’s specification also. The motivation for this definition is the following fact which we won’t prove. Proposition. We have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(\\mathcal A)}(Y,X) = \\operatorname{colim}_{X \\underset{q.i}{\\to} X^\\prime} \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(\\mathcal A)}(Y,X^\\prime)\\) . Another fact: . Propsition. The full subcategory of objects of $D(\\mathcal A)$ where $\\mathbf{R}F$ is exists is a triangulated subcategory and is closed under retracts. Let’s see that under our common assumptions that things agree. Proposition. Assume that $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives and countable products. Then \\(\\mathbf{R}F(X) \\cong F(I_X)\\) for a quasi-isomorphism $X \\to I_X$ with $I_X$ K-injective. Proof. (Expand to view) Given any quasi-isomorphism $X \\to X^\\prime$, we can find a quasi-isomorphism $X^\\prime \\to I^\\prime$ with $I^\\prime$ K-injective. Thus, $$ \\operatorname{colim}_{X \\underset{q.i}{\\to} X^\\prime} \\operatorname{Hom}(Y, FX^\\prime ) \\cong \\operatorname{colim}_{X \\underset{q.i}{\\to} I^\\prime} \\operatorname{Hom}(Y, FI^\\prime ) $$ where the later is colimit is take over all quasi-isomorphism $X \\to I^\\prime$ with $I^\\prime$ K-injective. Given two such $X \\to I$ and $X \\to I^\\prime$, we have seen that $I$ and $I^\\prime$ are homotopy equivalent. Thus, $FI$ and $FI^\\prime$ are homotopy equivalent. In particular, they are quasi-isomorphic. So the colimit is constant and isomorphic to to any $FI$. &#9632; . We get also have the analogous statement for left derived functors. Definition. Given an object $A \\in \\mathcal A$, the i-th derived functor $\\mathbf{R}^iF(A)$ is \\(\\mathbf{R}^iF(A) := H^i(\\mathbf{R}F(A))\\) . So, as an example, \\(\\operatorname{Ext}^i_{\\mathcal A}(A,B) := H^i(\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B))\\) Given that Hom is a bifunctor, there is possibly some ambiguity in the notation $\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)$. Lemma. Assume that $\\mathcal A$ has enough projectives and enough injectives. Then, \\(\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}(A,B) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(P,B) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(A,I)\\) where $P \\to A$ is a projective resolution and $B \\to I$ is an injective resolution. Proof. (Expand to view) We just need to exhibit a quasi-isomorphism. We have with the both being quasi-isomorphisms because $P$ is K-projective and $I$ is K-injective. &#9632; . One of the most often used properties of $\\mathbf{R}^iF$ or $\\mathbf{L}^iF$ is the following. Proposition. Let \\(0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0\\) be an exact sequence in $\\mathcal A$. Then we have a long exact sequence \\(\\cdots \\to \\mathbf{R}^iFA \\to \\mathbf{R}^iFB \\to \\mathbf{R}^iFC \\to \\mathbf{R}^{i+1}FA \\to \\cdots\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Let $\\phi : A \\to B$ denote the map. We have a map $C(\\phi) \\to C$ which is a quasi-isomorphism. Thus, $$ A \\to B \\to C $$ is isomorphic in $D(\\mathcal A)$ to a triangle and hence is one. Since $\\mathbf{R}F$ is exact, we have a triangle $$ \\mathbf{R}FA \\to \\mathbf{R}FB \\to \\mathbf{R}F C \\to \\mathbf{R}FA[1] $$ Taking the long exact sequence of homology gives the conclusion. &#9632; . We don’t necessarily need to use injectives or projectives to compute derived functors. Definition. An object $A$ of $\\mathcal F$ is called (right) adapted to $F$ if \\(\\mathbf{R}^iFA = 0 \\ \\text{ for } i \\neq 0.\\) . Lemma. Let $A \\to A^\\prime$ be a quasi-isomorphism of bounded below complexes whose components are adapted to $F$. Then $FA \\to FA^\\prime$ is a quasi-isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) [Homework](/homework/02/) &#9632; . Of course any injective object is adapted for any $F$. But, in general, that can be more adapted objects and it may be easier to build resolutions out of them. Definition. Given a left $R$-module $M$ and a right $R$-module $N$, the i-th Tor modules is \\(\\operatorname{Tor}^R_i(M,N) := H^{-i}(M \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes} N)\\) . Note that since $\\otimes_R$ is right exact we have \\(\\operatorname{Tor}_0^R(M,N) \\cong M \\otimes_R N.\\) . Similar to the above, we have that Tor is symmetric in the two variables. Lemma. If $P \\to M$ and $Q \\to N$ are projective resolutions, then $P \\otimes_R N$ and $M \\otimes_R Q$ are quasi-isomorphic. Proof. (Expand to view) We have two maps $$ P \\otimes_R N \\leftarrow P \\otimes_R Q \\to M \\otimes_R Q $$ which we want to check are quasi-isomorphisms. Here $P \\otimes_R Q$ is a complex with $$ (P \\otimes_R Q)^i = \\bigoplus_{a+b=i} P^a \\otimes_R Q^b $$ and $$ \\delta_{P \\otimes_R Q}(p \\otimes q) = \\delta_P(p) \\otimes q + (-1)^a p \\otimes \\delta_Q(q) $$ where $p \\otimes q \\in P^a \\otimes_R Q^b$. Consider the subcategory of chain complexes satisfying the condition that $$ X \\otimes_R Q \\to X \\otimes_R N $$ is a quasi-isomorphism. This contains any projective module and is closed under shifts. It is also closed under taking cones. This tells us that any bounded complex of projectives lives in this category. Now let $X$ be a bounded above complex of projectives. Then, to consider any particular homology map, we only need to use $\\tau_{\\geq j} X$ for some $j$. Thus, $X$ can also be a bounded above complex of projectives and we see the two maps are isomorphisms. &#9632; . Recall that $F$ is flat if $F \\otimes_R -$ is exact. Proposition. The following are equivalent: . | $F$ is flat. | $\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F,-) = 0$ for $i &gt; 0$. | $\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,-) = 0$. | . Proof. (Expand to view) Assume that $F$ is flat. And take $P \\twoheadrightarrow M$ with $P$ projective. Then, we have a short exact sequence $$ 0 \\to \\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,M) \\to F \\otimes_R K \\to F \\otimes P \\to F \\otimes M \\to 0 $$ Since $F$ is flat, we know that $$ 0 \\to F \\otimes_R K \\to F \\otimes P \\to F \\otimes M \\to 0 $$ is exact also. Thus $\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,M) = 0$. We also have $$ \\operatorname{Tor}_2^R(F,M) \\cong \\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,K) $$ As we have $\\operatorname{Tor}_1$ vanishing for any $M$, we get $\\operatorname{Tor}_2^R(F,M) = 0$ for any $M$ also. Moving up the chain we get $\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F,-) = 0$. If $\\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F,-) = 0$ for $i &gt; 0$, then certainly $\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,-) = 0$. Assume that $\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,-) = 0$. Take any exact sequence $$ 0 \\to A \\to B \\to C \\to 0 $$ and we get an exact sequence $$ \\cdots \\to \\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,C) \\to F \\otimes_R C \\to F \\otimes_R B \\to F \\otimes_A \\to 0 $$ Since $\\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(F,C) = 0$, we have that $$ 0 \\to F \\otimes_R C \\to F \\otimes_R B \\to F \\otimes_R A \\to 0 $$ is exact. &#9632; . Let’s compute an example. Example. We really only have one projective resolution so far: the Koszul resolution for $k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$. In the tensor product, \\(K(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\otimes_{k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]} k\\) and the maps reduce to $0$ since their images land in the submodule generated by $(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$. So \\(H^{-i}\\left(K(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\otimes_{k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]} k \\right) = K^i \\otimes k = k^{n \\choose i}\\) . ",

    "content": "We now turn to studying the following question. To shorten notation we write \\(D(R) := D(\\operatorname{Mod} R)\\) for $R$ a ring. Question. Assume \\(D(R) \\cong D(S).\\) How do $R$ and $S$ compare? . The naive guess is that $R$ and $S$ are isomorphic. This is not true but also not terribly far off. Before we head to an equivalence of derived categories, we should note that \\(\\operatorname{Mod} R \\cong \\operatorname{Mod} S\\) does not imply $R \\cong S$ in general. Definition. Two rings $R$ and $S$ are called Morita equivalent if there is an equivalence of categories of module categories. \\(\\operatorname{Mod} R \\cong \\operatorname{Mod} S\\) . The name comes a paper of Kiiti Morita which gives a characterization such equivalences. Theorem. $R$ and $S$ are Morita equivalent if and only if there exists an $R$-$S$ bimodule $U$ for which \\(- \\otimes_R U : \\operatorname{Mod} R \\to \\operatorname{Mod} S\\) is an equivalence. You can extract properties which are equivalent to $U$ furnishing an equivalence but we will not elaborate here as we will be focused on derived Morita equivalence next. What we will provide the following counter-example to the naive expectation. From reading the proof, you can tease out some of these condition, though. Proposition. Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let \\(M_n(R) := \\operatorname{End}_R(R^{\\oplus n})\\) for some $n &gt; 0$. Then, $R$ and $M_n(R)$ are Morita equivalent. Let $U := R^{\\oplus n}$. Consider the functor \\(- \\otimes_R U : \\operatorname{Mod} R \\to \\operatorname{Mod} M_n(R)\\) . This comes with a right adjoint \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,-): \\operatorname{Mod} M_n(R) \\to \\operatorname{Mod} R\\) . We consider the full subcategories $\\mathcal C$ where the unit \\(\\eta : M \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,M \\otimes_R U)\\) is an isomorphism and $\\mathcal D$ where the counit \\(\\epsilon : \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,N) \\otimes_R U \\to N\\) is an isomorphism. We will prove the proposition be establishing a few properties of $\\mathcal C$ and $\\mathcal D$ which will then imply \\(\\begin{aligned} \\mathcal C &amp; \\cong \\operatorname{Mod} R \\\\ \\mathcal D &amp; \\cong \\operatorname{Mod} M_n(R) \\end{aligned}\\) . Lemma. The homomorphism \\(\\begin{aligned} R &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,U) \\\\ r &amp; \\mapsto r \\cdot 1_U \\end{aligned}\\) is an isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) Let $\\phi: U \\to U$ be a $M_n(R)$-module morphism. Then we have a commutative diagram for any $A \\in M_n(R)$. Fix a basis $e_1,\\ldots,e_n$ for $R^{\\oplus n}$. We take $E_{ij}$ $$ E_{ij}(e_l) := \\begin{cases} e_j &amp; l = i \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{else} \\end{cases} $$ Then, $$ \\phi \\circ E_{ij}(e_i) = \\phi(e_j) = \\sum \\phi_{jl} e_l $$ while $$ E_{ij} \\circ \\phi(e_i) = \\phi_{ij} e_j $$ Thus, $\\phi$ is a represented by a diagonal matrix: $\\phi(e_i) = \\phi_{ii} e_i$ for each $i$. And $\\phi_{jj} e_j = \\phi_{ii} e_j$ so $\\phi$ is an $R$ multiple of the identity map. &#9632; . Lemma. $R \\in \\mathcal C$ and $M_n(R) \\in \\mathcal D$. Proof. (Expand to view) We need to check that the map $$ \\begin{aligned} R &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, R \\otimes_R U) \\\\ r &amp; \\mapsto r \\cdot 1_U \\end{aligned} $$ is an isomorphism as is $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,U) \\otimes_R U &amp; \\to U \\\\ \\phi \\otimes u &amp; \\mapsto \\phi(u) \\end{aligned} $$ For the first map, via the natural isomorphism $R \\otimes_R U \\cong U$, we reduce to the previous lemma. The previous lemma also gives the second. &#9632; . Lemma. The natural map \\(\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U,N_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} N_i)\\) is an isomorphism for any $N_a, a \\in A$. Proof. (Expand to view) Note that $$ M_n(R) \\cong U^{\\oplus n} $$ in $\\operatorname{Mod} M_n(R)$. Thus, $U$ is a retract of $M_n(R)$ and the natural map $$ \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(M_n(R),N_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(M_n(R), \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} N_i) $$ is an isomorphism. Thus, it is also for $U$. &#9632; . Lemma. Assume that $M_i \\in \\mathcal C$ for $i \\in I$ then $\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\in \\mathcal C$. Similarly, if $N_i \\in \\mathcal D$ for $i \\in I$, then $\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} N_i \\in \\mathcal D$. Proof. (Expand to view) We have to check that $$ \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\otimes_R U) $$ is an isomorphism. For each each $i$ we have isomorphisms $$ M_i \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, M_i \\otimes_R U) $$ Taking direct sums gives an isomorphism $$ \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\to \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, M_i \\otimes_R U) $$ The original map is the composition of this with the map $$ \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, M_i \\otimes_R U) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{M_n(R)}(U, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\otimes_R U) $$ The final map is an isomorphism from the previous lemma. Checking the other statement is analogous. &#9632; . One final property. Lemma. Assume we have an exact sequence \\(F^{-1} \\to F^0 \\to M \\to 0\\) with $F^i \\in \\mathcal C$. Then $M \\in \\mathcal C$. Similarly, if we have an exact sequence \\(G^{-1} \\to G^0 \\to N \\to 0\\) with $G^i \\in \\mathcal D$, then $N \\in \\mathcal D$. Proof. (Expand to view) Since $U$ is projective both as an $R$-module and as an $M_n(R)$-module, we know that $- \\otimes_R$ and $\\operatorname{Hom}(U,-)$ are exact. Thus we have a commutative diagram with exact rows and where the left two vertical maps are isomorphisms. The final vertical map is then also an isomorphism. Again, the other statement is analogous. &#9632; . We can now give the proof the proposition. Proof. (Expand to view) The full subcategory $\\mathcal C \\subseteq \\operatorname{Mod} R$ - contains $R$ - is closed under all coproducts and - is closed under cokernels. Since any module admits a presentation $$ R^{\\oplus I_1} \\to R^{\\oplus I_0} \\to M \\to 0 $$ we see that all modules are in $\\mathcal C$. The same argument shows that $\\mathcal D = \\operatorname{Mod} M_n(R)$. &#9632; . ",

    "content": "An important part of establishing Morita equivalence between $R$ and $M_n(R)$ was that fact that the natural map \\(\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}(U, N_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(U, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} N_i)\\) was an isomorphism. This is equivalent to saying we can factor any $f: U \\to \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} N_i$ as . where $|I_f| &lt; \\infty$. Objects with the property are very useful. They go be different names depending on the context. We will be focused on triangulated categories. Definition. Let $\\mathcal T$ be a triangulated category. An object $X$ is called compact if the natural map \\(\\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(X, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} Y_i)\\) is isomorphism for any $Y_i, i \\in I$. The full subcategory of compact objects in $\\mathcal T$ is denoted by $\\mathcal T^c$. Lemma. $\\mathcal T^c$ is triangulated and closed under retracts. Proof. (Expand to view) We have $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(X[n], \\bigoplus Y_i) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(X, \\bigoplus Y_i[n]) $$ so $X[n] \\in \\mathcal T^c$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Next, take a map $X \\to X^\\prime$ of compact objects and complete it to a triangle $$ X \\to X^\\prime \\to C \\to X[1] $$ We get a commutative diagram with exact rows and where two out of the three vertical maps are isomorphisms. Thus, the third is also. Finally, if $X^\\prime$ is a retract of $X$, the map $$ \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} \\operatorname{Hom}(X^\\prime,Y_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(X^\\prime, \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} Y_i) $$ is a retract of an isomorphism. Hence it is an isomorphism. &#9632; . Definition. We say $\\mathcal T$ is compactly generated if it has small coproducts and there exists a set of compact objects $\\mathcal C$ such that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(C,Y) = 0 \\ \\forall C \\in \\mathcal C\\) implies $Y = 0$. The set $\\mathcal C$ is called a set of compact generators. Lemma. A map $X \\to Y$ in $\\mathcal T$ with \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(C,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,Y)\\) an isomorphism for all $C$ in a set of compact generators is an isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) The map $X \\to Y$ is an isomorphism if and only if $\\operatorname{cone}(X \\to Y) = 0$. Since we have a set of compact generators, we only need to check that $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(C,\\operatorname{cone}(X \\to Y)) = 0 $$ for all $C$. But this is equivalent to the map $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,Y) $$ being an isomorphism for all $C$. &#9632; . Example. $D(R)$ is compactly generated. Indeed, \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(R)}(R[n],Y) \\cong H^{-n}Y\\) If all of these are $0$, then $Y$ is acyclic and hence $0$ in $D(R)$. Definition. Given a sequence of composable maps \\(X_0 \\overset{f_0}{\\to} X_1 \\overset{f_1}{\\to} X_2 \\overset{f_2}{\\to} \\cdots\\) the homotopy colimit is the cone over the morphism $\\bigoplus X_i \\to \\bigoplus X_i$ induced by the maps \\(X_i \\overset{1,-f_i}{\\to} X_i \\oplus X_{i+1}\\) . Lemma. If $C$ is compact, then the natural map \\(\\operatorname{colim} \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_\\bullet) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,\\operatorname{hocolim} X_\\bullet)\\) is an isomorphism. Proof. (Expand to view) We have a commutative diagram where the left two vertical maps are isomorphisms and the rows are exact. Since the map $$ \\bigoplus \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_i) \\to \\bigoplus \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_i) $$ is injective we see that we have a short exact sequence $$ 0 \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C, \\bigoplus X_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C, \\bigoplus X_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,\\operatorname{hocolim} X_\\bullet) \\to 0 $$ also. Thus, the map $$ \\operatorname{colim}\\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_\\bullet) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,\\operatorname{hocolim} X_\\bullet) $$ is also an isomorphism. &#9632; . Proposition. If $\\mathcal C$ is a compact set of generators, then the smallest subcategory of $\\mathcal T$ that . | is closed under $\\bigoplus$’s | is triangulated and | contains $\\mathcal C$ | . is $\\mathcal T$ itself. Proof. (Expand to view) Let $$ U_0 := \\bigcup_{C \\in \\mathcal C} \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X) $$ Set $$ X_0 := \\bigoplus_{(C,f) \\in U_0} C $$ This comes with a natural evaluation map $$ X_0 \\to X. $$ We work not by induction having constructed $\\nu_i : X_i \\to X$. We let $$ U_i := \\bigcup_{C \\in \\mathcal C} \\lbrace f : C \\to X_i \\mid \\nu_i f = 0 \\rbrace $$ Let $$ K_i := \\bigoplus_{(C,f) \\in U_i} C $$ and set $X_{i+1} = \\operatorname{cone}(K_i \\to X_i)$. The composition $K_i \\to X_i \\to X$ is $0$ so there exists a $X_{i+1} \\to X$ We let $X = \\operatorname{hocolim} X_\\bullet$. Using the above lemma, it suffices to check that $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(C,\\operatorname{hocolim}X_\\bullet) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X) $$ is any isomorphism for any $C \\in \\mathcal C$. From the other lemma, this is the the same as $$ \\operatorname{colim}\\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_\\bullet) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X) $$ being an isomorphism. Any element of the colimit is represented by some $f: C \\to X_i$. If $\\nu f : C \\to X$ is $0$, then $f \\in U_i$ be definition and, in fact, $f = 0$ in the colimit. Given any $g: C \\to X$, then $g \\in U_0$. So there is some $C \\to X_0$ whose composition with $X_0 \\to X$ is $g$. Thus, we have an isomorphism. &#9632; . If we have a compact generating set $\\mathcal C$, we can also use it characterize all compact objects in $\\mathcal T$. The following is due to Neeman. Proposition. Let $\\mathcal C$ be a set of compact generators for $\\mathcal T$. The smallest triangulated subcategory of $\\mathcal T$ . | containing $\\mathcal C$ and | closed under retracts | . is $\\mathcal T^c$. Proof. (Expand to view) Pick some $X \\in \\mathcal T^c$. From the proof the proposition, we know that $$ X \\cong \\operatorname{hocolim} X_\\bullet $$ where each $X_i$ is obtained as a cone over a map $K_{i-1} \\to X_{i-1}$ with $K_{i-1}$ a sum of elements of $\\mathcal C$. We also know that $$ 1_X \\in \\operatorname{Hom}(X,X) \\cong \\operatorname{colim}\\operatorname{Hom}(X,X_i) $$ Thus, there exists $X \\to X_i$ such that So $X$ is a retract of $X_i$. The composition $X \\to X_i \\to K_{i-1}[1]$ factors through a finite summand of $K_{i-1}$. Denote that by $K_{i-1}^\\prime$ and let $X^\\prime_{i-1}[1]$ be the cone over $X \\to K_{i-1}^\\prime[1]$. Now repeat the procedure to produce From repeated applications of the octahedral axiom, the cone of the map $X^\\prime_l \\to X$ is sequence of cones over the cones of $X^\\prime_{j-1} \\to X^\\prime_j$. Each of these cones is a finite sum of objects from $\\mathcal C$ by construction. Thus the cone over $X_l \\to X$ for any $l$ lies in the smallest triangulated subcategory containing the objects of $\\mathcal C$. From the commutative square we see that $X^\\prime_{-1} \\to X$ is $0$ as $X \\to X_i \\to X$ is the identity. Thus, $X$ and $X^\\prime_{-1}$ are summands over the cone of $X_{-1}^\\prime \\to X$. &#9632; . Definition. A complex $P$ in $D(R)$ is called perfect if it is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projectives. The full subcategory of perfect objects is denoted by $\\operatorname{perf} R$. Proposition. We have \\(D(R)^c = \\operatorname{perf} R\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) It is easy to see that $$ \\operatorname{perf} R \\subseteq D(R)^c $$ since compact objects are closed under finite direct sums, summands, and cones. But $\\operatorname{perf} R$ - contains $R[n]$ for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ (a set of compact generators) - is triangulated and - is closed under retracts. Thus, the previous proposition says $$ D(R)^c \\subseteq \\operatorname{perf} R $$ &#9632; . Finally it useful to introduce some notation for generation. Definition. Given a subcategory $\\mathcal S$ of a triangulated category $\\mathcal T$, we let $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle$ denote the smallest triangulated subcategory of $\\mathcal T$ containing $\\mathcal S$. We also let $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}$ denote the smallest triangulated, closed under retracts, containing $\\mathcal S$. ",

    "content": "Definition. Let $k$ be a commutative ring. A differential graded algebra or dg-algebra or DGA is $k$-algebra $A$ with a decomposition as $k$-modules \\(A = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z} } A^i\\) and $k$-linear maps \\(\\delta^i : A^i \\to A^{i+1}\\) such that . | multiplication is of degree $0$ \\(A^i \\cdot A^j \\subseteq A^{i+j}\\) | $\\delta$ is a $k$-linear differential: $\\delta^0(1) = 0$ and $\\delta^{i+1} \\delta^i = 0$ for all $i$ | $\\delta$ satisfies the graded Liebniz rule for multiplication in $A$ \\(\\delta(aa^\\prime) = \\delta(a)a^\\prime + (-1)^{|a|} a \\delta(a^\\prime)\\) where $a$ and $a^\\prime$ are homogeneous of degrees $|a|$ and $|a^\\prime|$. | . A morphism $f: A \\to B$ of dg-algebras is a $k$-algebra morphism with \\(f(A^i) \\subseteq B^i\\) and \\(\\delta_B \\circ f - f \\circ \\delta_A = 0\\) . A dg-module $M$ over a dg-algebra $A$ is an $A$-module with a $k$-module decomposition \\(M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z} } M^i\\) and differential \\(\\delta^i : M^i \\to M^{i+1}\\) such that . | \\[A^i \\cdot M^j \\subseteq M^{i+j}\\] | \\[\\delta_M(a \\cdot m) = \\delta_A(a) \\cdot m + (-1)^{|a|} a \\cdot \\delta_M(m)\\] | . A morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$ of dg-modules over a dg-algebra $A$ is an $A$-module homomorphism with \\(\\phi(M^i) \\subseteq N^i\\) and \\(\\delta_N \\circ \\phi - \\phi \\circ \\delta_M = 0\\) Note that any $\\phi$ induces a homomorphism of cohomology groups \\(H^i(\\phi) : H^i(M) \\to H^i(N)\\) so we can speak of quasi-isomorphisms. We have an additive category $\\operatorname{Mod} A$ of (left) dg-modules over a dg-algebra $A$. Inside there lies the full subcategory $\\operatorname{Acyclic} A$ of dg-modules with \\(H^\\ast(M) = 0\\) . The derived category $D(A)$ is the localization of $\\operatorname{Mod} A$ at the class of quasi-isomorphisms with the same definition for the derived category of an abelian category, replacing $\\operatorname{Ch} \\mathcal A$ with $\\operatorname{Mod} A$. This is sensible thing to do because of the following lemma. Lemma. If $A$ is a dg-algebra with $A^i = 0$ for $i \\neq 0$, then there is an isomoprhism \\(\\operatorname{Ch}(\\operatorname{Mod} A^0) \\cong \\operatorname{Mod} A\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Any chain complex $(M^i,\\delta^i)$ of $A^0$ modules gives a dg-module over $A$ with $$ M = \\bigoplus M^i $$ and $\\delta$ being the differential. And vice-versa. &#9632; . Given two dg-modules $M$ and $N$, we have a chain complex whose degree $i$ term is \\(\\operatorname{Hom}^i(M,N) := \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{gr} A}(M,N[i])\\) where $\\operatorname{gr} A$ is the underlying graded algebra of $A$ , ie just $A$ and toss out the differential. Morphisms are taken to be degree $0$. The differential on \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(M,N) = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{Hom}^i(M,N)\\) is given by \\(\\delta \\phi := \\delta_N \\circ \\phi - (-1)^{|\\phi|} \\phi \\circ \\delta_M\\) . The groups $H^0(\\operatorname{Hom}(M,N))$ give the morphisms in the homotopy category of dg-modules over $A$, $K(A)$. Following the course of $D(\\mathcal A)$, we can also talk about K-projective and K-injective dg-modules. A dg-module $P$ is K-projective if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(P,C) = 0\\) for any $C \\in \\operatorname{Acyclic} A$. A dg-module $I$ is K-injective if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(C,I) = 0\\) for any $C \\in \\operatorname{Acyclic} A$. Proposition. Assuming there are enough K-projective dg-modules, then \\(K-Proj(A) \\to D(A)\\) is an equivalence. Similarly, assuming there are enough K-injective dg-modules, \\(K-Inj(A) \\to D(A)\\) is an equivalence. Proof. (Expand to view) The proof is completely analogous to [the one](/notes/2021_09_23/) for the derived category of an abelian category. We suppress it. &#9632; . We need to determine if we have enough K-projectives and K-injectives. We have some obvious K-projective objects. Lemma. There is a natural isomorphism \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(A,M) \\to H^0(M)\\) for any dg-module $M$. Proof. (Expand to view) In the category $\\operatorname{gr} A$, we have the map $$ \\begin{aligned} \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{gr} A}(A,M) &amp; \\to M^0 \\\\ \\phi &amp; \\mapsto \\phi(1) \\end{aligned} $$ is an isomorphism. For the map $a \\mapsto am$ to commute with differential we need $\\delta_M(m) = 0$. The null-homotopic maps are those coming from $$ \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\operatorname{gr} A}(A,M[-1]) &amp; \\to M^{-1} $$ after applying $\\delta_M$, ie the image of $\\delta_M$. Thus, $$ \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(A,M) \\to H^0(M) $$ &#9632; . Consequently, we also have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(A[i],M) \\to H^{-i}(M)\\) Thus all $A[i]$ are K-projective. To show we have enough K-projective dg-modules, we need to use the triangulated category structure on $K(A)$. It is completely analogous to $K(\\mathcal A)$. Given a morphism $\\phi : M \\to N$, we can form the cone \\(M[1] \\oplus N, \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta_{M[1]} &amp; \\phi \\\\ 0 &amp; \\delta_N \\end{pmatrix}\\) The triangles for the structure are those isomorphic to \\(M \\overset{\\phi}{\\to} N \\to C(\\phi) \\to M[1]\\) . Proposition. This collection of triangles with the shift $[1]$ endow $K(A)$ with structure of a triangulated category. Since the proof is very similar to that for $K(\\mathcal A)$, we omit it. We turn to constructing enough K-projectives using a method similar to the “resolution” by compact objects in a compactly-generated triangulated category. Let $M$ be a dg-module over $A$. Let $U_0$ be a generating set for the $k$-module $H^\\ast(M)$ and choose a lift $\\tilde{u} \\in M$ for each $u \\in U_0$. Set \\(P_0 := \\bigoplus_{u \\in U_0} A[-|u|]\\) This has a natural map \\(\\begin{aligned} P_0 &amp; \\to M \\\\ 1_{u} &amp; \\mapsto \\tilde{u} \\end{aligned}\\) and we have exact sequence \\(H^\\ast(P_0) \\to H^\\ast(M) \\to 0\\) of graded $k$-modules. Let $N$ be the kernel of the map $H^\\ast(P_0) \\to H^\\ast(M)$ and let $U_1$ be a generating set for it as a $k$-module and choose a lift $\\tilde{u} \\in P_0$ for each $u \\in U_1$ and set \\(Q_1 := \\bigoplus_{u \\in U_1} A[-|u|]\\) The map $Q_1 \\to P_0 \\to M$ induces the zero map on cohomology. Since $Q_1$ is a direct sum of shifts of $A$, it is therefore the zero map in $K(A)$. Thus, we get an induced map \\(P_1 := C(Q_1 \\to P_0) \\to M\\) . Now, we proceed inductively to construct $P_i \\to M$ and we set \\(P := \\operatorname{colim} P_i\\) . We need to check that $P$ is . | K-projective and | the map $P \\to M$ is a quasi-isomorphism. | . For K-projectivity, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(\\operatorname{colim} P_i , C) = \\operatorname{lim} \\operatorname{Hom}_{K(A)}(P_i,C) = 0\\) For a quasi-isomorphism, one can check that each \\(H^\\ast(P_i) \\to H^\\ast(M) \\to 0\\) is surjective. If $u \\in H^\\ast(P_i)$ maps to $0$, in $H^\\ast(M)$, then by construction its image in $P_{i+1}$ is $0$ and $u$ is $0$ in the colimit. Proposition. For any dg-algebra $A$ and any dg-module $M$, there is a K-projective dg-module $P$ and a quasi-isomorphism $P \\to M$. There are enough K-injective dg-modules but we outsource the proof. ",

If \\(\\overline{\\langle P \\rangle} = D(A)^c\\) then $\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}(P,-)$ is an equivalence. Proof. (Expand to view) Let $F := \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}(P,-)$ for ease of notation. Let $\\mathcal C$ be the full subcategory consisting of $X \\in D(\\mathcal A)$ such that $$ F: \\operatorname{Hom}(P,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(FP,FX) $$ is an isomorphism. By construction, $P[l] \\in \\mathcal C$ for all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal C$ is - triangulated and - closed under $\\bigoplus$ as $P$ is compact. Thus, $\\mathcal C = D(\\mathcal A)$ as we assumed $D(\\mathcal A)$ is compactly generated.

Moreover, $\\mathcal D$ is - triangulated and - closed under coproducts since $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(\\bigoplus X_a, Y) \\cong \\prod \\operatorname{Hom}(X_a,Y) $$ and $F$ commutes with coproducts. Thus $\\mathcal D = D(\\mathcal A)$. Finally, let $\\mathcal E$ be the essential image of $F$. We have $A[l] \\in \\mathcal E$ for all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal E$, triangulated since we any $\\phi: M \\to N$ in $\\mathcal E$ is of the form $F(\\psi)$ by the previous step and the cone $\\psi$ maps to the cone of $\\phi$. $\\mathcal E$ is closed under coproducts since $F$ commutes with them. Thus $\\mathcal E = D(A)$ and we see that $F$ is fully-faithful and essentially surjective. &#9632; . We can extract the proof technique of the previous statement. Proposition. Let $F: \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal S$ be an exact functor between compactly generated triangulated categories.

Then, $F$ is an equivalence. The previous proposition gives a reasonable criteria to describe $D(\\mathcal A)$ when you have a compact generator. If we know that \\(H^\\ast(A) = H^0(A)\\) then we still don’t know that $D(\\mathcal A) \\cong D(H^0(A))$ just yet. We need to say something more. Let $A$ and $B$ be dg-modules and $U$ be a dg-$A$-$B$-bimodule.

As with the case of usual modules, we also have a right adjoint \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_A (U,-) : \\operatorname{Mod} A \\to \\operatorname{Mod} B\\) and its derived version \\(\\mathbb{R} \\operatorname{Hom}_A (U,-) : D(A) \\to D(B)\\) . We can to consider these functor in a special case. Let $f: A \\to B$ be quasi-isomorphism of dg-algebras. Then, $B$ is a $A$-$B$ dg-bimodule. Proposition. If $f: A \\to B$ is a quasi-isomorphism, then \\(B \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A - : D(A) \\to D(B)\\) is an equivalence. Proof. (Expand to view) We apply the previous proposition in the case $F = B \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A -$. Note that $$ B \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A[l] \\cong B[l] $$ for each $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus $F$ takes a set of compact generators to a set of compact generators. Moreover, multiplication $$ a \\mapsto a^\\prime a $$ goes to multiplication by $f(a^\\prime)$. Since $f$ is quasi-isomorphism, we see that $F$ is fully-faithful on subcategory consisting of the $A[l]$. &#9632; . Lemma. If $A$ is a dg-algebra with $H^i(A) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0$, then $A$ and $H^0(A)$ are quasi-isomorphic. Proof. (Expand to view) Let $$ (\\tau_{\\geq l} A)^i = \\begin{cases} A^i &amp; i &gt; l \\\\ A^l/\\delta A^{l-1} &amp; i = l \\\\ 0 &amp; i &lt; l \\end{cases} $$ Then, we have a have a homomorphism $A \\to \\tau_{\\geq l} A$ which is a quasi-isomorphism in degrees $\\geq l$. If $H^i(A) = 0$ for $i &lt; l$, then it is a quasi-isomorphism overall. Similarly, for $$ (\\tau_{\\leq l} A)^i = \\begin{cases} A^i &amp; i &lt; l \\\\ \\ker \\delta^l &amp; i = l \\\\ 0 &amp; i &gt; l \\end{cases} $$ we have a homomorphism $\\tau_{\\leq l} A \\to A$ which is a quasi-isomorphism in degrees $\\leq l$ and overall if $H^i(A) = 0$ for $i &gt; l$. If $H^i(A) = 0$ for $i \\neq 0$, then is diagram with quasi-isomorphisms and $$ \\tau_{\\geq 0} \\tau_{\\leq 0} A \\cong H^0(A) $$ given the diagram of quasi-isomorphisms. &#9632; . From our discussion before, if we assume that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(P,P[l]) = 0 \\text{ for } l \\neq 0\\) then we get . Proposition. $D(\\mathcal A) \\cong D(R)$ where $R$ is the ring $R = \\operatorname{Hom}(P,P)$. Proof.

This gives us our recognition principle. Specializing to the case that $\\mathcal A = \\operatorname{Mod} S$ for a ring $S$, we have the following statement which is originally due to Rickard.

In general, we would work the derived tensor product $B \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_k A$ as a dg-algebra. Deriving this is beyond the scope of this course since dg-algebras do not form an additive category. DG-bimodules give functors. We introduce some notation. Given a $B$-$A$ dg-module $U$, we write \\(\\Phi_U (M) := U \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A -\\) . We can lift the identity functor to a bimodule using $A$ as a $A$-$A$ bimodule since \\(A \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A M \\cong M\\) In general, this bimodule is denoted by $\\Delta_A$ and called the diagonal bimodule. Furthermore, we can lift composition to the level of bimodules. Let $A,B,C$ be dg-algebras. Assume we have a $B$-$A$ dg-module $U$ and a $C$-$A$ dg-module $V$.

It turns out easier to show that $P \\otimes_k Q$ generates a set of compact objects. Given this, the smallest thick triangulated category containing $P \\otimes_k Q$ is all compact objects. Therefore, we just need to generate $A \\otimes_k B$. We know that $$ A \\in \\overline{\\langle P \\rangle} $$ Since $\\otimes_k Q$ is exact, we have $$ A \\otimes_k Q \\in \\overline{\\langle P \\otimes_k Q \\rangle} $$ We also have $$ B \\in \\overline{\\langle Q \\rangle} $$ so we have $$ A \\otimes_k B \\in \\overline{\\langle A \\otimes_k Q \\rangle} $$ Combining the two, we have $$ A \\otimes_k B \\in \\overline{\\langle P \\otimes_k Q \\rangle} $$ &#9632; .

Here you should think $X$ and $B$ are “locally look like rings” but are have global geometry. The replacement for modules over rings will be the category of quasi-coherent sheaves $\\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ on $X$. Like modules over a ring, we can tensor two such over the structure sheaf $\\mathcal O_X$ of $X$. Given a map $f: X \\to Y$ of schemes over $B$, we get a few operations on quasi-coherent sheaves. The most familiar one, from discussion so far, is pullback \\(f^\\ast : \\operatorname{Qcoh} Y \\to \\operatorname{Qcoh} X\\) Locally $f$ corresponds to a map of rings \\(\\phi : R \\to S\\) and $f^\\ast$ is $S \\otimes_R -$. The other one is pushforward \\(f_\\ast : \\operatorname{Qcoh} X \\to \\operatorname{Qcoh} Y\\) If $X$ and $Y$ were just rings (ie affine schemes), then $f_\\ast$ would be the restriction of scalars along the ring homomorphism $\\phi$. In general, $f_\\ast$ is more global. Indeed, it can viewed as akin to integration along the fibers of the map $f: X \\to Y$. We still have the adjunction \\(f^\\ast \\vdash f_\\ast\\) . The globalization of tensoring with a bimodule comes from take a quasi-coherent sheaf $\\mathcal K$ on the fiber product $X \\times_B Y$. The fiber product has two maps \\(p : X \\times_B Y \\to X\\) and \\(q : X \\times_B Y \\to Y\\) .

We write \\(\\mathcal T = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle\\) to denote an SOD. The mental picture of a SOD is an upper triangular matrix. Example. Let $A$ and $B$ be dg-algebras and let $P$ be an $A$-$B$ bimodule. We form a new dg-algebra $U$ whose elements are represented as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a &amp; p \\\\ 0 &amp; b \\end{pmatrix}\\) since multiplication is given by what you would expect from the notation \\(\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 &amp; p_1 \\\\ 0 &amp; b_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a_2 &amp; p_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; b_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1a_2 &amp; a_1p_2 + p_1b_2 \\\\ 0 &amp; b_1b_2 \\end{pmatrix}\\) Let $M$ be a $U$ dg-module. We have an inclusion of \\(A \\times B \\to U\\) so each $M$ has the structure of a $A \\times B$ dg-module. We can take that two idempotents \\(e_A := (1,0) \\in A \\times B \\\\ e_B := (0,1) \\in A \\times B\\) and set \\(M_A := e_A M \\\\ M_B := e_B M\\) We have $M = M_A \\oplus M_B$. Each $p \\in K$ induces a $k$-linear map \\(p : M \\to M\\) As $pe_A = 0$ and $e_Bp = 0$, we see that the only nonzero component in the decomposition $M = M_A \\oplus M_B$ is the map \\(p : M_B \\to M_A.\\) From the algebra structure we see that . | $P \\otimes_k M_B \\to M_A$ descends to a map \\(\\psi_M: P \\otimes_B M_B \\to M_A\\) and | the map \\(\\psi_M: P \\otimes_B M_B \\to M_A\\) is a homomorphism of $A$ dg-modules. | .

From the data of $(M,N,\\psi)$ we can recover the structure of a $U$ dg-module on $M := M \\oplus M^\\prime$. Thus, we have an equivalence between $\\operatorname{Mod} U$ and the category of triples $(M,N,\\psi)$ with morphisms being pairs $(f,g)$ which make . commute. Any $A$-module $M$ determines a $U$-module with $(M,0,0)$. Similarly, Any $B$-module $N$ determines a $U$-module with $(0,N,0)$. These given fully-faithful functors \\(\\imath_A : \\operatorname{Mod} A \\to \\operatorname{Mod} U \\\\ \\imath_B : \\operatorname{Mod} B \\to \\operatorname{Mod} U\\) Moreover, we have natural isomorphisms \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_U(\\imath_A M, N) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_A(M,N_A)\\) and \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_U(M,\\imath_B N) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_B(M_B,N)\\) Thus, \\(\\begin{aligned} \\rho_A : \\operatorname{Mod} U &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Mod} A \\\\ M &amp; \\mapsto M_A \\end{aligned}\\) is right adjoint to $\\imath_A$ and \\(\\begin{aligned} \\lambda_A : \\operatorname{Mod} U &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Mod} B \\\\ M &amp; \\mapsto M_B \\end{aligned}\\) is left adjoint to $\\imath_B$. Since both $\\rho_A$ and $\\lambda_B$ preserve acyclicity, we see that . Lemma. For any K-projective $A$-module $Q$, the $U$-module $\\imath_A Q$ is also K-projective. For any K-injective $B$-module $I$, the $U$-module $\\imath_B I$ is also K-injective. Corollary. We have fully-faithful functors \\(\\imath_A : D(A) \\to D(U) \\\\ \\imath_B : D(B) \\to D(U)\\) The images are triangulated subcategories of $D(U)$. We have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_D(U)(\\imath_A M, \\imath_B N) = 0\\) since \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(U)}(\\imath_A M, \\imath_B N) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{D(A)}(M, \\rho_A \\imath_B N) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_{D(A)}(M, 0) = 0\\) . Finally, for any $M$ we have a the co-unit \\(\\epsilon_M : \\imath_A \\rho_A M \\to M\\) and the triangle \\(\\imath_A \\rho_A M \\to M \\to C(\\epsilon) \\to \\imath_A \\rho_A M[1]\\) Note that $\\imath_A \\rho_A M = M_A$ so we have a sequence \\(0 \\to M_A \\to M \\to M_B \\to 0\\) which is exact as graded $k$-modules. There is a natural map \\(C(\\epsilon) \\to M_B\\) which is a quasi-isomorphism. Thus, $C(\\epsilon)$ lies in $D(B)$ (up to isomorphism) and we have a semi-orthogonal decomposition. From considerations at the level of $\\operatorname{Mod} U$, we might think this a completely orthogonal decomposition. However, that is rarely the case. To compute \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{D(U)}(\\imath_B N, \\imath_A M)\\) in terms of homotopy classes we need to replace $\\imath_B N$ by a K-projective resolution or $\\imath_A M$ by a K-injective resolution. Since $\\imath_B$ does not necessarily preserve K-projectivity, we cannot simply replace $N$ in $K(B)$ and apply $\\imath_B$. Similarly, we cannot resolve $M$ by a K-injective in $K(A)$ and call it a day. Viewing $P$ as a functor \\(\\begin{aligned} \\Phi_P : D(B) &amp; \\to D(A) \\\\ N &amp; \\mapsto P \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_B N \\end{aligned}\\) we can think of $D(U)$ as gluing together a copy of $D(A)$ and $D(B)$ via $\\Phi_P$. We will see this and the ideas that popped in the discussion of $D(U)$ appearing when we discuss properties of semi-orthogonal decompositions in general. ",

The assignment \\(\\begin{aligned} \\lambda_A : \\mathcal T &amp; \\to \\mathcal A \\\\ X &amp; \\mapsto X_A \\\\ f &amp; \\mapsto f_A \\end{aligned}\\) is a functor and left adjoint to $\\imath_A : \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal T$. The assignment \\(\\begin{aligned} \\rho_B : \\mathcal T &amp; \\to \\mathcal B \\\\ X &amp; \\mapsto X_B \\\\ f &amp; \\mapsto f_B \\end{aligned}\\) is a functor and right adjoint to $\\imath_B : \\mathcal B \\to \\mathcal T$. Proof. (Expand to view) The previous lemma tells us that each are functors. For adjunction, we already saw that $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(B,B^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X^\\prime) $$ and $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(A,A^\\prime) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(X,A^\\prime) $$ are isomorphisms. &#9632; . We have $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathcal B^{\\perp}$ but more can be said. Lemma. We have \\(\\mathcal A = \\mathcal B^{\\perp}\\) and \\(\\mathcal B = {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Assume we have $X \\in \\mathcal T$ with $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(B,X) = 0 $$ for all $B \\in \\mathcal B$. We have the triangle $$ B \\to X \\to A \\to B[1] $$ and the map $B \\to X$ must be $0$. Therefore, $$ A \\cong X \\oplus B $$ Now $B \\in \\mathcal B$ and is a summand of $\\mathcal A$. Since $\\mathcal A \\subset \\mathcal B^{\\perp}$ and summand of $\\mathcal A$ also lies in $\\mathcal B^{\\perp}$. Thus, $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(B,B) = 0 $$ and $B = 0$. So $X \\in \\mathcal A$. The argument for the other equivalence is similar. &#9632; . The previous results show that a single component in a SOD completely captures all information. We introduce some notation for this first. Definition. We say full triangulated subcategory is left admissible if the inclusion admits a left adjoint. We say it is right admissible if the inclusion admits a right adjoint. If it is both left and right admissible, we say it is admissible. Proposition. The following are equivalent: . | $\\mathcal T = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle$ | $\\mathcal A$ is left admissible. | $\\mathcal B$ is right admissible. | . The previous proposition gives a bit more flexibility for verifying an SOD. Example. Let $R$ be commutative Noetherian ring and $I \\leq R$ an ideal. We say that $M \\in \\operatorname{Mod} R$ is $I$-torsion if for every $m \\in M$ there exists $j &gt; 0$ such that $I^jm = 0$. Inside $D(R)$, we have the full triangulated subcategory $D_I(R)$ consisting of all complexes $C$ with $H^\\ast(C)$ $I$-torsion. The inclusion $D_I(R)$ admits a right adjoint \\(M \\mapsto \\operatorname{colim}_n \\operatorname{Hom}_R(R/I^n,J)\\) where $J$ is a K-injective replacement for $M$. The cohomology of this is often called the local cohomology of $M$ with respect to the ideal $I$. From the proposition, there is a semi-orthogonal decomposition \\(D(R) = \\langle D_I(R)^{\\perp}, D_I(R) \\rangle\\) . The objects of $D_I(R)^{\\perp}$ are often $I$-local or torsion-free. There is an equivalence \\(j^\\ast : D_I(R)^{\\perp} \\to D(U)\\) where $U$ is the quasi-affine scheme \\(U = \\operatorname{Spec} R \\setminus V(I)\\) and given by $j : U \\to \\operatorname{Spec} R$. In general, $U$ is not going to be affine. But, here is a special case. Take $R = k[x]$ and $I = (x)$. Then, \\(D_{(x)}(k[x])^{\\perp} \\cong D(k[x,x^{-1}])\\) and the map \\(k[x] \\to k[x,x^{-1}]\\) in the inclusion. Given an admissible $\\mathcal A \\subseteq \\mathcal T$, we get two SODs \\(\\mathcal T = \\langle \\mathcal A, {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A \\rangle\\) and \\(\\mathcal T = \\langle \\mathcal A^{\\perp}, \\mathcal A \\rangle\\) and we can compare ${}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A$ and $\\mathcal A^{\\perp}$ \\(\\begin{aligned} L_{\\mathcal A}: {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A &amp; \\to \\mathcal A^{\\perp} \\\\ B &amp; \\mapsto \\rho_{\\mathcal A^{\\perp} } \\imath_{ {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A} B \\end{aligned}\\) and \\(\\begin{aligned} R_{\\mathcal A}: \\mathcal A^{\\perp} &amp; \\to {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A \\\\ B &amp; \\mapsto \\lambda_{ {}^{\\perp} \\mathcal A } \\imath_{ \\mathcal A^{\\perp} } B \\end{aligned}\\) The functor $L_{\\mathcal A}$ is called left mutation and $R_{\\mathcal A}$ is right mutation. Lemma. $L_{\\mathcal A}$ and $R_{\\mathcal A}$ are inverse. Proof. (Expand to view) Let $B \\in {}^\\perp \\mathcal A$. To mutate it into $\\mathcal A^\\perp$, we fit it into a triangle $$ A \\to B \\to B^\\prime \\to A_B[1] $$ To mutate it back we fit $B^\\prime$ into a triangle of the form $$ B^{\\prime \\prime} \\to B^\\prime A^\\prime \\to B^{\\prime \\prime}[1] $$ We notice that shifting the previous triangle gives $$ B \\to B^\\prime \\to A_B[1] \\to B[1] $$ one such. Thus, $$ R_{\\mathcal A} L_{\\mathcal A} \\cong \\operatorname{Id} $$ Similarly, $$ L_{\\mathcal A} R_{\\mathcal A} \\cong \\operatorname{Id} $$ &#9632; . While the left and right orthogonals to an admissible $\\mathcal A$ are equivalent, the actual subcategories in $\\mathcal T$ can appear quite different. ",

    "content": "When people say SOD they usually mean a longer one in general. We can give a general definition along the lines of the two term one. Definition. A sequence of $\\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l$ of full triangulated subcategories of $\\mathcal T$ is a semi-orthogonal decomposition if . | for each $1 \\leq i \\leq l$ we have \\(\\mathcal A_i \\subseteq {}^\\perp\\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{i-1} \\rangle \\cap \\langle \\mathcal A_{i+1},\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l \\rangle^\\perp\\) | for each object $X$ of $\\mathcal T$ there is a diagram | . with $A_i \\in \\mathcal A_i$ for each $i$, the dashed arrows are of homological degree $1$, and the triangles are actual triangles in $\\mathcal T$. Let’s assume that each of the $\\mathcal A_i$ are admissible subcategories. Then, we are free to mutate them. Given a length $l$ SOD $\\langle \\mathcal A_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal A_l \\rangle$, we have the left mutation at $i$ \\(\\mathbf{L}_i := \\langle \\mathcal A_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal A_{i-1}, \\mathcal A_{i+1}^\\prime, \\mathcal A_i, \\mathcal A_{i+2}, \\ldots, \\mathcal A_l \\rangle\\) with \\(\\mathcal A_{i+1}^\\prime := {}^\\perp\\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{i-1} \\rangle \\cap \\langle \\mathcal A_i, \\mathcal A_{i+1},\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l \\rangle^\\perp\\) and right mutation \\(\\mathbf{R}_i := \\langle \\mathcal A_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal A_{i-1}, \\mathcal A_{i+1}, \\mathcal A_i^{\\prime}, \\mathcal A_{i+2}, \\ldots, \\mathcal A_l \\rangle\\) with \\(\\mathcal A_i^\\prime := {}^\\perp\\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{i-1},\\mathcal A_{i+1} \\rangle \\cap \\langle \\mathcal A_{i+2},\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l \\rangle^\\perp\\) Each is can be accomplishbed via left/right mutation in the subcategory $\\langle \\mathcal A_i, \\mathcal A_{i+1} \\rangle$. Given this, we have already seen that $\\mathbf{L}_i^{-1} = \\mathbf{R}_i$ . Let $\\operatorname{SOD}_l(\\mathcal T)$ denote the set of semi-orthogonal decompositions of length $l$. Then, we get an action of the free group on ${1,\\ldots,l}$ on $\\operatorname{SOD}_l(\\mathcal T)$ with $j$ acting via $\\mathbf{L}_j$. Proposition.

Proof. (Expand to view) Since the categories $$ \\langle \\mathcal A_i, \\mathcal A_{i+1} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal A_{i+1}^\\prime, \\mathcal A_i \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal A_{i+1}, \\mathcal A_i^\\prime \\rangle $$ all coincide, we can compute the left or right orthogonal using any of them when they all lie on the same the term. Assume that $i &lt; j$ for simplicity. Then the $j$-th component of $\\mathbf{L}_i \\mathbf{L}_j$ is $$ {}^\\perp\\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{j-1} \\rangle \\cap \\langle \\mathcal A_{j+1},\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l \\rangle^\\perp $$ where as the $j$-th component of $\\mathbf{L}_j \\mathbf{L}_i$ is $$ {}^\\perp\\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{j+1}^\\prime, \\mathcal A_j,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{j-1} \\rangle \\cap \\langle \\mathcal A_{j+1},\\ldots,\\mathcal A_l \\rangle^\\perp $$ Since $$ \\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{j-1} \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal A_1,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{i+1}^\\prime, \\mathcal A_i,\\ldots,\\mathcal A_{j-1} \\rangle $$ these coincide. Similarly, one can check the other components coincide in the case $|i - j| &gt; 1$. For the other identity, it suffices to consider the case $\\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B, \\mathcal C \\rangle$. We only need to identity two components as any component is determined by the two others. The third component of both is $\\mathcal A$ by definition. The second component of $\\mathbf{L}_1 \\mathbf{L}_2 \\mathbf{L}_1$ is $$ \\mathcal B^\\prime = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal C \\rangle^\\perp $$ Since $$ \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle = \\mathcal C^\\perp $$ and $$ \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal C \\rangle^\\perp = \\mathcal A^\\perp \\cap \\mathcal C^\\perp $$ we see that $$ \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle \\cap \\mathcal A^\\perp = \\mathcal B^\\prime $$ The second component of $\\mathbf{L}_2 \\mathbf{L}_1 \\mathbf{L}_2$ is $$ \\widetilde{\\mathcal B}^{\\prime} = {}^\\perp \\left( \\mathcal C^{\\prime\\prime} \\right) \\cap \\mathcal A^\\perp $$ where $$ \\mathcal C^{\\prime \\prime} = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle^\\perp $$ So $$ \\widetilde{\\mathcal B}^{\\prime} = {}^\\perp \\left( \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle^\\perp \\right) \\cap \\mathcal A^\\perp $$ But $$ {}^\\perp \\left( \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle^\\perp \\right) = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle $$ since we have an SOD $$ \\langle \\mathcal C^{\\prime \\prime}, \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle \\rangle \\rangle $$ Thus, $$ \\mathcal B^\\prime = \\widetilde{\\mathcal B}^{\\prime} $$ &#9632; . The group with the presentation \\(B_{n+1} := \\langle \\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_n \\mid \\sigma_i\\sigma_j = \\sigma_j\\sigma_i \\text { if } |i-j| &gt; 1 \\text{ and } \\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i = \\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} \\rangle\\) has a natural geometric meaning. It is the braid group on $n+1$ strands. This can be described as follows. Elements of this group are isotopy classes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ of smooth cobordisms between the points $n+1$ points on a line in the plane and $n+1$ points on a parallel line in the plane. Collapsing the points should not know the strands. Composition is concatenation. For example, . is an element of $B_3$ represented by $s_1 s_2^{-1}$ (reading left to right). It is straightforward to see that the relations in $B_{n+1}$ hold for the braid group. It is a fact, due to (Emil) Artin, that those generate all the relations. As a consequence of the presentation, we get an action of $B_l$ the set of semi-orthogonal decompositions of length $l$. Not much is known about this action in general. For example, can we classify the orbits in some concrete way? . ",

    "content": "Another fundamental tool in the study of derived categories is the Serre functor. We work with a triangulated category $\\mathcal T$ which is linear over a field $k$. We will set \\(V^\\ast := \\operatorname{Hom}_k(V,k)\\) . Definition. A Serre functor is an auto-equivalence $S: \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal T$ for which there are natural isomorphisms \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y)^\\ast \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}(Y,S(X))\\) . Example. Let $A$ be a dg-algebra over $k$. We set \\((-)^\\vee := \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_A(-,A)\\) . There is natural map \\(M^\\vee \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A N \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(M,N)\\) The subcategory of pairs $(M,N)$ where this is an isomorphism . | contains $(A[l],A[s])$ for each $l,s \\in A$, | is triangulated in $M$ and $N$, | is closed under retracts in both $M$ and $N$, and | is closed under arbitrary coproducts in $N$. | . Thus this is an isomorphism for any perfect $M$ and any $N$. Using tensor-Hom adjunction, we have \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_k(M^\\vee \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A N,k) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_A(N, \\operatorname{Hom}_k(M^\\vee,k))\\) . Thus, if we have Serre functor, then we know its form must be \\(S(M) := \\left(M^\\vee\\right)^\\ast\\) The question becomes whether \\(M \\mapsto \\left(M^\\vee\\right)^\\ast\\) is an auto-equivalence. Assuming it is an auto-equivalence, we know the $S$ commutes with $\\bigoplus$. However, it not reasonable to expect \\(\\bigoplus (M_t^\\vee)^\\ast \\to \\left(\\left(\\bigoplus M_t \\right)^\\vee \\right)^\\ast\\) to be an isomorphism for general $M$. One needs some finiteness in general, either for $M$ as an $A$-module or $H^\\ast M$ as a $k$-module or both. We will restrict ourselves now to assuming that $A$ is proper over $k$. Recall this means that $\\dim H^\\ast A &lt; \\infty$ and we will assume that $M$ and $N$ are perfect $A$-modules. We have a natural map \\(M \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^\\ast (M^\\vee)^\\ast\\) which one can check is isomorphism for perfect $M$. Given that we can write $S$ as tensoring with the bimodule $A^\\ast$, it makes sense to look for another bimodule $A^!$ with \\(A^! \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^\\ast \\cong A\\) and \\(A^\\ast \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^! \\cong A\\) . Consider \\(\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A, A \\otimes_k A) \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^\\ast\\) If we assume that $A$ is compact, we have \\(\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A, A \\otimes_k A) \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^\\ast \\to \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A, A \\otimes_k A^\\ast)\\) is an isomorphism.

Now, we can use tensor-hom adjunction \\(A \\cong \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A \\otimes_k A, A) \\to \\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A, \\operatorname{Hom}_k(A,A))\\) to see that \\(\\mathbf{R}\\operatorname{Hom}_{A \\otimes_k A^{op}}(A, A \\otimes_k A) \\overset{\\mathbf{L}}{\\otimes}_A A^\\ast \\cong A\\) We get a similar isomorphism if we tensor in the other order.

Furthermore, when $A$ is a compact bimodule, $\\operatorname{perf} A$ is equivalence to the category $D(\\operatorname{mod}_{fd} A)$ of $A$-modules with total cohomology finite dimensional over $k$.

    "content": "Existence of semi-orthogonal decompositions and if Serre functors strongly depending on representability of functors. It is useful to have strong general criteria for such. Here we will review a criteria for “large” categories: compactly generated triangulated categories. Next we will cover one for “small” categories, often categories of compact objects in compactly generated triangulated categories. Recall that a functor $H: \\mathcal T^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$ is cohomological if for any triangle \\(X \\to Y \\to Z \\to X[1]\\) the resulting sequence \\(\\cdots \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(X,W) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(Y,W) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(Z,W) \\rightarrow \\operatorname{Hom}(X[1],W) \\rightarrow \\cdots\\) is exact. We say that $H$ takes coproducts to products if the natural map \\(H\\left(\\bigoplus X_a \\right) \\to \\prod H(X_a)\\) is an isomorphism for any coproduct. Theorem. (Brown Representability) Let $\\mathcal T$ be a compactly generated triangulated category and $H : \\mathcal T^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Ab}$ a functor. Then $H$ is representable if and only if $H$ is cohomological and takes coproducts to products. Proof. (Expand to view) We have seen that representable functors must take triangles to long exact sequences and coproducts to products. So assume that $H$ is a cohomological functor which takes coproducts to products and let $\\mathcal C$ be a set of compact generators. Set $$ U_0 := \\bigcup_{C \\in \\mathcal C} H(C) $$ so each element is a pair $(C,u)$ with $C \\in \\mathcal C$ and $u \\in H(C)$. Set $$ X_0 := \\bigoplus_{(C,u) \\in U_0} C $$ If we apply $H$ to $X_0$, we get $$ H(X_0) = \\prod_{U_0} H(C) $$ We have the distinguished element $\\xi_0 \\in H(X_0)$ given by $u \\in H(C)$ for the factor $(C,u)$. From Yoneda, we get a natural transformation $$ \\xi_0 : h^{X_0} \\to H $$ Now assume we have constructed $X_n$ and $\\xi_n : h^{X_n} \\to H$. We set $$ U_n := \\bigcup_{C \\in \\mathcal C} \\operatorname{ker} \\left(\\xi_n(C) : \\operatorname{Hom}(C,X_n) \\to H(C) \\right) $$ and set $$ Y_n := \\bigcup_{U_n} C $$ Since each element of $U_n$ is a map $C \\to X_n$, we get a map $Y_n \\to X_n$. We let $$ X_{n+1} := \\operatorname{cone}(Y_n \\to X_n) $$ We want to show that $\\xi_n : h^{X_n} \\to H$ comes via composition from some $\\xi_{n+1} : h^{X_{n+1}} \\to H$. If we apply $H$ to the triangle, we get $$ \\cdots \\leftarrow H(Y_n) \\leftarrow H(X_n) \\leftarrow H(X_{n+1}) \\leftarrow \\cdots $$ an exact sequence. The map $$ H(X_n) \\to H(Y_n) = \\prod_{U_n} H(C) $$ takes $\\xi_n$ to the element $\\prod_{(C,u)} \\xi_n(C)(u) = 0$. Thus, there is some $\\xi_{n+1} \\in H(X_{n+1})$ with $H(f_{n+1})(\\xi_{n+1}) = \\xi_n$ for $f_{n+1} : X_n \\to X_{n+1}$. This is equivalent to commuting. Now we let $X = \\operatorname{hocolim} X_n$. We check that we have a natural transformation $h^X \\to H$ induced from the $\\xi_n$. We have triangle $$ \\bigoplus X_n \\to \\bigoplus X_n \\to \\operatorname{hocolim} X_n \\to \\bigoplus X_n [1] $$ We apply $H$ to get an exact sequence $$ \\prod H(X_n) \\leftarrow \\prod H(X_n) \\leftarrow H(\\operatorname{hocolim} X_n) $$ So we need to check that $\\prod \\xi_n$ lie in the kernel. Recall the map $1-f: \\bigoplus X_n \\to \\bigoplus X_n$ when restricted to the factor $X_n$ is $$ X_n \\overset{\\operatorname{id}_{X_n},-f_{n+1}}{\\to} X_n \\oplus X_{n+1} $$ Applying $H$ we have $$ H(1-f)\\left(\\prod \\xi_n \\right) = \\prod (\\xi_n - H(f_n)(\\xi_{n-1})) $$ We saw that $\\xi_n = H(f_n)(\\xi_{n-1})$ so the image is $0$. Thus, we have some $\\xi \\in H(\\operatorname{hocolim} X_n)$ giving us the desired $\\xi : h^X \\to H$. Let $\\mathcal S$ be the full subcategory of objects $Y$ of $\\mathcal T$ for which $$ \\xi(Y) : \\operatorname{Hom}(Y,X) \\to H(Y) $$ is an isomorphism. Since both $h^X$ and $H$ take triangles to long exact sequences, we see that $\\mathcal S$ is triangulated. Since both takes coproducts to products, we see $\\mathcal S$ is closed under coproducts. Finally, take $C \\in \\mathcal C$. Then, $\\xi(C)$ is surjective as $\\xi_0(C)$ is surjective by construction. If $g : C \\to X_n$ has $\\xi(C)(g) = 0$. Then $g \\in U_n$ by construction so we have a lift Consequently $f_{n+1}g = 0$. Thus, $g: C \\to X$ is the zero map. We can conclude that $C \\in \\mathcal S$. From [previously] (% link notes/2021_10_05.md %) we see that $\\mathcal T = \\mathcal S$ and $X$ represents $H$. &#9632; . An immediate consequence of Brown Representability is a condition on existence of a right adjoint. Corollary. Let $F: \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal S$ be an exact functor between triangulated categories. If $\\mathcal T$ is compactly generated and $F$ commutes with coproducts, ie the natural map \\(\\bigoplus F(X_a) \\to F\\left(\\bigoplus X_a \\right)\\) is an isomorphism for coproducts, then $F$ has a right adjoint. Proof. (Expand to view) To construct the right adjoint is equivalent to representing the functor $$ \\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal S}(F(-),Y) : \\mathcal T^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Ab} $$ But, this functor is cohomological since $F$ is exact and representable functors are cohomology. It also takes coproducts to products. Thus, the previous result shows it is representable. &#9632; . ",

To define this, we need some intermediate notions. Defintion. Let $\\mathcal S$ be a subcategory of a triangulated category $\\mathcal T$. We write $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$ for the smallest additive subcategory closed under shifts and containing the objects of $\\mathcal S$. The smallest subcategory closed under retracts and containing $\\mathcal S$ is denoted $\\overline{\\mathcal S}$. Given another subcategory $\\mathcal S^\\prime$, we write $\\mathcal S \\ast \\mathcal S^\\prime$ for the full subcategory consisting of objects $X$ of $\\mathcal T$ for which there is triangle \\(S \\to X \\to S^\\prime \\to S[1]\\) with $S \\in \\mathcal S$ and $S^\\prime \\in \\mathcal S^\\prime$. For $n&gt;1$, we set \\(\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_n = \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_{n-1} \\ast \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_0\\) . We say that an object $G$ strongly generates $\\mathcal T$ if there is some $n$ with \\(\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n = \\mathcal T\\) . Lemma. The operation $\\ast$ is associative. Proof. (Expand to view) This is a consequence of the Octahedral Axiom, TR4. We will omit the details. &#9632; . From this lemma we see that \\(\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n = \\overline{\\underbrace{ {\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_0 \\ast \\cdots \\ast \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_0}}_n}\\) . We introduce another notion which we will see is related. Definition. Let $\\mathcal S$ be a subcategory of $\\mathcal T$. We say that a map $f: X \\to Y$ is $\\mathcal S$-ghost if \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(S,f) = 0\\) for all objects of $\\mathcal S$. Example. Take $R$, a ring, as an object of $D(\\operatorname{Mod} R)$. Then, a map $f: C \\to D$ is $R$-ghost if and only if the induced map \\(H^0(f) : H^0(C) \\to H^0(D)\\) is zero. Lemma. If $X \\to Y$ is ghost for all shifts of objects from $\\mathcal S$, then it is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_0$ -ghost. Proof. (Expand to view) Note that $$ \\operatorname{Hom}\\left( \\bigoplus S_i, f) = \\bigoplus \\operatorname{Hom}(S_i,f) $$ for finite sums. If $T$ is retract of an object $S$ and $\\operatorname{Hom}(S,f)=0$, then $\\operatorname{Hom}(T,f)$ is a retract of $0$ and hence is $0$. &#9632; . Lemma (Ghost Lemma). Let $\\mathcal S$ be a subcategory of a triangulated category $\\mathcal T$. If $f_{i+1}: X_i \\to X_{i+1}$ is a sequence of $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghosts for $0 \\leq i \\leq n$, then the composition $f_n \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_1$ is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_{n+1}$-ghost. Proof. (Expand to view) We prove this via induction on $n$. The case of $n=0$ is clear. For the induction step, we must prove that if $f: X \\to Y$ is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n$-ghost and $g: Y \\to Z$ is $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghost, then $gf$ is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_{n+1}$-ghost. In general, if a map $h$ is $\\mathcal R$-ghost for some subcategory $\\mathcal R$, then it is automatically $\\overline{\\mathcal R}$-ghost. So we reduce to checking $gf$ is $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_{n+1}$- ghost. For an object $U$ from $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_{n+1}$, we have a triangle $$ W \\to U \\to S \\to W[1] $$ with $W \\in \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n$ and $S \\in \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_0$. Given a map $U \\to X$, the composition $$ W \\to U \\to X \\overset{f}{\\to} Y $$ vanishes as $f$ is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n$-ghost. Thus, there exists a $S \\to Y$ making the diagram commute. But as $g: Y \\to Z$ is $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghost, the composition $$ S \\to Y \\to Z $$ is $0$. Thus, $$ U \\to X \\overset{f}{\\to} Y \\overset{g}{\\to} Z $$ is also $0$, and so, $gf$ is $\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_{n+1}$-ghost. &#9632; . Note that $\\mathcal S$-ghosts form an ideal in $\\mathcal T$. Corollary. Assume that there is a subcategory $\\mathcal S$ of $\\mathcal T$ with \\(\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n = \\mathcal T\\) Then, the ideal of $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghosts is uniformly nilpotent with degree $n$. Finally, if we can produce $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$ approximations, then we have a converse to the previous corollary. Lemma. Suppose we have a subcategory $\\mathcal S$ such that . | the ideal of $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghosts is uniformly nilpotent of degree $n$ and | for any object $X$ of $\\mathcal T$ there exists a triangle \\(S \\to X \\to Y \\to S[1]\\) with $S \\in \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_0$ and $X \\to Y$ $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$-ghost. | . Then, \\(\\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n = \\mathcal T\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Using induction, we can produce a sequence of ghosts $$ X_0 = X \\to X_1 \\to \\cdots \\to X_{n-1} \\to X_n $$ with $$ \\operatorname{cone}(X_i \\to X_{i+1}) \\in \\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0 $$ Let $Y$ be the cone over the composition $X \\to X_n$. Then from TR4 and the facts that each cone over $X_i \\to X_{i+1}$ lies in $\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_0$, one sees that $$ Y \\in \\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle_n $$ As it is composition of $n$ ghosts, the map $X \\to X_n$ is zero. Thus, $$ Y \\cong X_n \\oplus X[1] $$ So $$ X \\in \\overline{\\langle \\mathcal S \\rangle}_n $$ &#9632; . ",

    "content": "Definition. Let $\\mathcal T$ be a triangulated category linear over a field $k$. We say $\\mathcal T$ is Ext-finite if for any pair of objects $X$ and $Y$ we have \\(\\dim_k \\bigoplus_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{Hom}(X,Y[j]) &lt; \\infty\\) An additive functor $H : \\mathcal T \\to \\operatorname{Vect} k$ is Ext-finite if for any object $X$ we have \\(\\dim_k \\bigoplus_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} H(X[j]) &lt; \\infty\\) . Lemma. Let $\\mathcal T$ be an Ext-finite triangulated category and let $X$ and $Y$ be objects. Then there exists a triangle \\(Z \\to X \\to X^\\prime \\to Z[1]\\) where $Z \\in \\langle Y \\rangle_0$ and $X \\to X^\\prime$ is $\\langle Y \\rangle_0$-ghost. Proof. (Expand to view) We introduce some notation. For $$ \\operatorname{Hom}^\\ast(Y,X) \\otimes_k Y $$ we really mean $$ \\bigoplus_{i=1}^d Y[n_i] $$ where $d$ is the dimension of $\\bigoplus \\operatorname{Hom}(Y[j],X)$ and $n_1,\\ldots,n_d$ are the homological degrees of a basis. This object is independent of the basis up to isomorphism. There is a natural evaluation map $$ \\operatorname{Hom}^\\ast(Y,X) \\otimes_k Y \\to X $$ whose action of the factor $Y[n_i]$ is the corresponding map in the basis for $\\bigoplus \\operatorname{Hom}(Y[j],X)$. We set $$ Z = \\operatorname{Hom}^\\ast(Y,X) \\otimes_k Y $$ and use the triangle $$ Z \\to X \\to X^\\prime \\to Z[1] $$ where $X^\\prime$ is the cone over $Z \\to X$. By construction, any map $Y[l] \\to X$ will lift to $Y[l] \\to Z$. Just take the factor in $Z$ corresponding to $Y[l] \\to X$. Then, the composition $Y[l] \\to X \\to X^\\prime$ will be $0$. So $X \\to X^\\prime$ is $\\langle Y \\rangle_0$-ghost. &#9632; . Assume we have a cohomological functor $H : \\mathcal T^{op} \\to \\operatorname{Vect} k$ which is Ext-finite. We want to employ the “resolution” procedure from Brown representability to $H$ with a single object (and its shifts) playing the role of the compact generators. We start with \\(X_0 := \\bigoplus_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} H(G[j]) \\otimes_k G[j]\\) Since the summands of $X_0$ are indexed by elements $H(G[j])$, there is a natural element of $H(X_0)$ given by using the element from the index. From Yoneda, we get a natural transformation \\(\\xi_0 : h^{X_0} \\to H\\) . Inductively, we set \\(K_i(G[j]) := \\ker\\left( \\xi_i(G[j]): \\operatorname{Hom}(G[j],X_i) \\to H(G[j]) \\right)\\) and \\(Y_i := \\bigoplus_{j \\in \\mathbb{Z}} K_i(G[j]) \\otimes_k G[j]\\) We have natural map $Y_i \\to X_i$ and we let \\(X_{i+1} = \\operatorname{cone}(Y_i \\to X_i)\\) . Note that from Ext-finiteness of $\\mathcal T$ and $H$ all this constructions yield well-defined objects of $\\mathcal T$. As in the proof of Brown Representability, we get a natural transformation \\(\\xi_{i+1} : h^{X_i} \\to H\\) such that the diagram . commutes. Since we do not have anything beyond finite coproducts, we cannot pass to the homotopy colimit to achieve a representing object on the thick subcategory generated by $G$ so we need to prove that after finite number of steps we can do this. Lemma. On $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_0$, $H$ is isomorphic to a retract of $h^{X_1}$. Proof. (Expand to view) For any object $E \\in \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_0$, we have a commutative diagram where the diagonal map vanishes from the construction $X_1$. Thus, we get a map $$ H(E) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_1) $$ which splits $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_1) \\to H(E) $$ This construction is natural in $E$. &#9632; . So on $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_0$, we have represented our object, at least allowing for retracts. To achieve this we needed that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(S,X_i) \\to H(X_i) \\to 0\\) is exact and the composition \\(\\ker \\xi_i(S) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(S,X_i) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(S,X_{i+1})\\) is zero. We will show that we can achieve this for $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n$ by composing a sequence of the maps $X_i \\to X_{i+1}$. Proposition. For each $n \\geq 1$, there is an $M &gt; 0$ such that $H$ is isomorphic to a retract of $X_M$ on $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n$. Proof. (Expand to view) We will prove the following statement. For each $n$ there is a $N$ such that for any $E$ in $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n$ we have that * the sequence $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_N) \\to H(E) \\to 0 $$ is exact and * the composition $$ \\ker \\xi_N(E) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_N) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_{N+2}) $$ is $0$. Then we get $H$ is isomorphic to a retract of $h^{X_{N+2}}$ on $\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n$. The base case of the induction is the previous lemma. Assume it is true for $n$. Note it suffices to prove it for $\\langle G \\rangle_0 \\ast \\langle G \\rangle_n$ since the two conditions are preserved under passage to sums, shifts, and summands. Take $E$ lying in a triangle $$ F \\to E \\to E^\\prime \\to F[1] $$ with $F \\in \\langle G \\rangle_0$ and $E^\\prime \\in \\langle G \\rangle_n$. Then for each $m$, we have the commutative diagram We can take $m$ large enough so that $$ \\operatorname{coker} \\xi_m(E^\\prime) = \\operatorname{coker} \\xi_m(F) = 0 $$ A diagram chase gives a injective map $$ \\operatorname{coker} \\xi_m(E) \\to \\operatorname{ker} \\xi_m(E^\\prime[-1]) $$ Taking $m$ larger if necessary we have $$ \\operatorname{coker} \\xi_m(E) = 0 $$ so $$ \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_m) \\to H(E) \\to 0 $$ is exact. Finally, $m^\\prime &gt; m$ so that $$ \\operatorname{ker} \\xi_m(E) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(E,X_{m^\\prime}) $$ and $$ \\operatorname{ker} \\xi_m(F) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(F,X_{m^\\prime}) $$ are both $0$ maps. &#9632; . If we know that for some large enough $n$ we have \\(\\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n = \\mathcal T\\) then we get the following corollary due to Bondal and Van den Bergh . Corollary. If $\\mathcal T$ is a strongly generated Ext-finite triangulated category and $H$ is an Ext-finite (co)homological functor, then $H$ is representable by a retract of an object of $\\mathcal T$. Note that being a strongly generated triangulated category is a condition preserved by taking opposites. ",

    "content": "We saw last time that being strongly generated resulted in representability of many (co)homological functors. Today, we look at when familiar examples of triangulated categories are strongly generated. Question. Let $R$ be a Noetherian commutative ring. When is $D^b(\\operatorname{mod} R)$ strongly generated? When is $\\operatorname{perf} R$? . Definition. We say that $G$ is a generator of a triangulated category $\\mathcal T$ for every $E \\in \\mathcal T$ there is some $n$ with \\(E \\in \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n\\) . Note there is no a priori uniform, in $E$, bound on $n$. Lemma. If $\\mathcal T$ is strongly generated, then any generator of $\\mathcal T$ is a strong generator. Proof. (Expand to view) Assume that $$ \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n = \\mathcal T $$ and $H$ is a generator. Then there is some $m$ with $$ G \\in \\overline{\\langle H \\rangle}_m $$ But then $$ \\mathcal T = \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_n \\subseteq \\overline{\\langle \\overline{\\langle H \\rangle}_m \\rangle}_n = \\overline{\\langle H \\rangle}_{nm} \\subset \\mathcal T $$ &#9632; . Example. $R$ is a always a generator for $\\operatorname{perf} R$. So if $\\operatorname{perf} R$ is strongly generated then $R$ must also be a strong generator. Lemma. Let $F: \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal S$ be an exact, essentially surjective functor. If $\\mathcal T$ is strongly generated, then so is $\\mathcal S$. Proof. (Expand to view) We have $$ F\\left( \\overline{\\langle X \\rangle}_m \\right) \\subset \\overline{\\langle FX \\rangle}_m $$ So if $F\\mathcal T = \\mathcal S$ and $\\overline{\\langle X \\rangle}_m = \\mathcal T$, we get $$ \\overline{\\langle FX \\rangle}_m = \\mathcal S $$ &#9632; . Lemma. Let $\\mathcal T = \\langle \\mathcal A, \\mathcal B \\rangle$ be a semi-orthogonal decomposition. Then $\\mathcal T$ is strongly generated if and only if $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathcal B$ both are. Proof. (Expand to view) In a SOD, we have essentially surjective functors $$ \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal A \\\\ \\mathcal T \\to \\mathcal B $$ so if $\\mathcal T$ is strongly generated then so are both $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathcal B$. Assume that $G$ is a strong generator of $\\mathcal A$ and $H$ is strong generator of $\\mathcal B$. In an SOD, any object sits in a triangle $$ B \\to X \\to A \\to B[1] $$ with $A \\in \\mathcal A$ and $B \\in \\mathcal B$. Since $$ A \\in \\overline{\\langle G \\rangle}_m $$ and $$ B \\in \\overline{\\langle H \\rangle}_n $$ we have $$ X \\in \\overline{\\langle G \\oplus H \\rangle}_{mn} $$ &#9632; . Assume that Noetherian commutative $R$ is strong generator for $\\operatorname{perf} R$. We know that the ideal of $R$ is uniformly nilpotent and this ideal is exactly the maps in $D(R)$ which induce the zero map on cohomology. Let $t$ be a natural number. Let $M$ be a finitely generated module and $N$ an $R$-module. Then, taking a truncation of projective resolution of $M$ we see there is perfect complex $P$ with a map $P \\to M$ such that \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(P,N[i]) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}(M,N[i])\\) is an isomorphism for $0 \\leq i \\leq t$. Now take $N = R$. If for $t &gt; 1$ \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(M,R[t]) = 0\\) then we see that $M$ is a retract of a perfect complex of length $t$. Since any $n$-fold extension can be factored into a composition of extensions, the uniform bound on the nilpotence tell us that every finitely has a projective resolution of length at most the minimal number $t$ with \\(\\operatorname{perf} R = \\overline{\\langle R \\rangle}_t\\) . As a consequence, \\(D^b(\\operatorname{mod} R) = \\operatorname{perf} R\\) . Recall that we can test for regularity of local ring $(R,\\mathfrak m)$ by asking whether the projective dimension of $k(\\mathfrak{m})$ is finite. Corollary. $R$ is a strong generator for $\\operatorname{perf} R$ if and only if $R$ is regular, ie all local rings are regular. So strong generation of $\\operatorname{perf} R$ imposes strong conditions on the ring $R$. It turns out that is not the case for $D^b(\\operatorname{mod} R)$. The following result is due to Rouquier. Theorem. If $R$ is a finitely-generated $k$-algebra with $k$ a perfect field, then $D^b(\\operatorname{mod} R)$ is strongly generated. This result has since been improved. ",

We have a category $\\operatorname{Opens}(X)$ whose objects are open subsets and \\(\\operatorname{Hom}(U,V) = \\begin{cases} U \\to V &amp; U \\subseteq V \\\\ \\emptyset &amp; U \\not \\subseteq V \\end{cases}\\) . Definition. Let $\\mathcal C$ be a category. A pre-sheaf valued in $\\mathcal C$ $\\mathcal F$ on $X$ is a functor \\(\\mathcal F : \\operatorname{Opens}(X)^{op} \\to \\mathcal C\\) A morphisms of pre-sheaves is a natural transformation of the functors.

Then we have \\(i_{x \\ast} \\underline{C} (U) = \\begin{cases} C &amp; x \\in U \\\\ \\ast &amp; x \\not \\in U. \\end{cases}\\) This works, in particular, if $\\mathcal C$ is an abelian category. | . Definition. A pre-sheaf $\\mathcal F$ is a sheaf if given an open cover $U_\\alpha$ of $V$ and sections $s_\\alpha \\in \\mathcal F(U_\\alpha)$ satisfying \\(s_{\\alpha}|_{U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta} = s_{\\beta}|_{U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta}\\) for all $\\alpha, \\beta$, there exists a unique $s \\in \\mathcal F(V)$ with \\(s|_{U_\\alpha} = s_\\alpha\\) for all $\\alpha$. Morphisms of sheaves are morphisms of the underlying pre-sheaves. We have a forgetful functor \\(\\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal C) \\to \\operatorname{PreSh}(X,\\mathcal C)\\) which often has a left adjoint. To give a (somewhat) explicit description, we need an auxiliary notion. Definition. Let $x \\in X$ and $\\mathcal F$ a pre-sheaf on $X$ with values in $\\mathcal C$. Then the stalk of $\\mathcal F$ at $x$ is \\(\\mathcal F_x = \\operatorname{colim}_{x \\in U} \\mathcal F(U)\\) . In general, this need not exist. For common targets, like $\\operatorname{Ab}$, this is not an issue. Assume that $\\mathcal C$ has small colimits and limits. Let \\(\\widetilde{\\mathcal F}(U) \\subset \\prod_{x \\in U} \\mathcal F_x\\) where $(s_x)$ is a section of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal F}$ over $U$ if there exists a cover $V_\\alpha$ of $U$ and sections $s_\\alpha \\in \\mathcal F(V_\\alpha)$ with \\((s_\\alpha)_y = s_y\\) for all $y \\in V_\\alpha$. We call $\\widetilde{F}$ the sheafification of $\\mathcal F$. Proposition. The assignment \\(\\mathcal F \\mapsto \\widetilde{\\mathcal F}\\) is a functor \\(\\operatorname{PreSh}(X,\\mathcal C) \\to \\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal C)\\) which is left adjoint to the forgetful functor \\(\\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal C) \\to \\operatorname{PreSh}(X,\\mathcal C)\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) Note that $$ U \\mapsto \\prod_{x \\in U} C_x $$ is a sheaf so we only need to check that the condition: \"there exists a cover $V_\\alpha$ of $U$ and sections $s_\\alpha \\in \\mathcal F(V_\\alpha)$ with $$ (s_\\alpha)_y = s_y $$ for all $y \\in V_\\alpha$\" cuts out a subsheaf. We leave the reader to convince themselves of this. Next, one checks that if $\\mathcal G$ is a sheaf then any map $\\phi: \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G$ admits a unique factorization &#9632; . Assume that $\\mathcal A$ is an abelian category and sheafification exists. Then we have a an abelian category structure on $\\operatorname{PreSh}(X,\\mathcal A)$ where \\(0 \\to \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G \\to \\mathcal H \\to 0\\) if exact if each \\(0 \\to \\mathcal F(U) \\to \\mathcal G(U) \\to \\mathcal H(U) \\to 0\\) is exact. Given a map $\\phi : \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G$, then $\\ker \\phi$ is a sheaf in general but $\\operatorname{cok} \\phi$ is not. We transfer the abelian category structure to $\\operatorname{Sh}(X, \\mathcal A)$ using sheafification. Precisely, in $\\operatorname{Sh}(X, \\mathcal A)$ \\(\\operatorname{cok} \\phi (U) := \\widetilde{\\operatorname{cok} \\phi(U)}\\) . We lose exactness on open sets in general but still have a simple criteria for exactness in $\\operatorname{Sh}(X, \\mathcal A)$. Proposition. A sequence of sheaves \\(\\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G \\to \\mathcal H\\) is exact if and only if for each $x \\in X$ the sequence of stalks \\(\\mathcal F_x \\to \\mathcal G_x \\to \\mathcal H_x\\) is exact. Proof. (Expand to view) We note that $$ \\widetilde{\\mathcal F}_x = \\mathcal F_x $$ for all $x \\in X$. One checks that exactness reduces to this. We leave the details to the reader. &#9632; . If $\\mathcal A$ has enough injectives then so does $\\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal A)$. For each $x \\in X$, we choose some injection \\(\\mathcal F_x \\to \\mathcal I(x)\\) to get \\(\\widetilde{F} \\to \\prod \\mathcal F_x \\to \\prod \\mathcal I(x)\\) which still has no kernel. One then checks that . Lemma. The sheaf $\\prod \\mathcal I(x)$ is injective in $\\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal A)$. As a consequence, we can define right derived functors. One of particular interest is global sections. The functor \\(\\begin{aligned} \\Gamma(X,-) : \\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal A) &amp; \\to \\mathcal A \\\\ \\mathcal F &amp; \\mapsto \\mathcal F(X) \\end{aligned}\\) is left-exact but not right exact in general. Definition. The i-th (sheaf) cohomology of $\\mathcal F$ is the i-th right derived functor of global sections \\(H^i(X,\\mathcal F) := \\mathbf{R}^i\\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F)\\) . One very useful computational tool is the following. Proposition. Assume we have an exact sequence of sheaves \\(0 \\to \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G \\to \\mathcal H \\to 0\\) then we get a long exact sequence of cohomologies \\(0 \\to H^0(X,\\mathcal F) \\to H^0(X,\\mathcal G) \\to H^0(X,\\mathcal H) \\to H^1(X,\\mathcal F) \\to \\cdots\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) We have seen that right derived functors are homological and we know that $$ 0 \\to \\mathcal F \\to \\mathcal G \\to \\mathcal H \\to 0 $$ provides a triangle in $D(\\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal A))$. &#9632; . Global sections is special case of a more general functor between categories of sheaves coming from continuous maps of topological spaces. Definition. Given a continuous map $f: X \\to Y$, we have the pushforward \\(f_\\ast : \\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal C) \\to \\operatorname{Sh}(X,\\mathcal C)\\) where \\(f_\\ast \\mathcal F(U) := F(f^{-1}U)\\) . Note that for the map $f: X \\to \\ast$ to the one-point space we have \\(f_\\ast \\mathcal F(\\ast) = \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F)\\) So the derived pushforward $\\mathbf{R}f_\\ast$ is generalization of cohomology which can be heuristically viewed as “cohomology along the fibers of $f$”. Definition. Given a sheaf $\\mathcal G$ on $Y$, we also have the pre-sheaf on $X$ \\(U \\mapsto \\operatorname{colim}_{f(U) \\subseteq V} \\mathcal G(V)\\) The inverse image sheaf under $f$ $f^{-1}\\mathcal G$ is the sheafification of this pre-sheaf. Proposition. We have an adjunction $f^{-1} \\vdash f_\\ast$. ",

    "content": "There are two standard perspectives on “global geometry” today: . | Figure out a model for your space and build some global construct that locally looks like your model. | Declare that all interesting spaces are cut out in some fixed global models. | . These two approaches are not mutually exclusive. For example, a smooth manifold is locally modeled on open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and smooth maps between such. But, we are interested when such things embed in some $\\mathbb{R}^N$ which is the content of the Whitney Embedding Theorem. At this point, we feel pretty good about rings and modules over them, especially if the ring is commutative. We will take approach 1. above to build a geometry, called schemes, locally modeled on rings and then turn to 2. for most practical tasks. The following will be the global setting. Definition. A ringed space is a pair $(X,\\mathcal O)$ where $X$ is a topological space and $\\mathcal O$ is a sheaf of commutative rings on $X$. We will often omit $\\mathcal O$ from the notation or write $\\mathcal O_X$. We say $(X,\\mathcal O)$ is a locally ringed space if for each $x \\in X$, $\\mathcal O_x$ is a local ring. A map of ringed spaces \\(f : (X, \\mathcal O_X) \\to (Y, \\mathcal O_Y)\\) consists of the data of a continuous map $f: X \\to Y$ and a map of sheaves of rings \\(f^{\\#} : f^{-1} \\mathcal O_Y \\to \\mathcal O_X\\) . Note that by adjunction we get a map \\(\\mathcal O_Y \\to f_\\ast \\mathcal O_X\\) additionally. A map of locally ringed spaces is a map of ringed spaces which is a local homomorphism on the stalks of $\\mathcal O$. Example. The central example where $\\mathcal O_X$ is the sheaf of $\\mathbb{R}$-valued functions. If $X$ admits more structure, say of a smooth or complex manifold, we can then talk about functions satisfying local properties like $C^\\infty$ or holomorphic. Given a continuous map $F : X \\to Y$ and continuous function $g : V \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we get a continuous function \\(g \\circ F : F^{-1} V \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) which furnishes \\(F^{\\#} : F^{-1} \\mathcal O_Y \\to \\mathcal O_X\\) . Definition. For a ringed space $(X,\\mathcal O)$, we let $\\operatorname{Mod} \\mathcal O$ denote the (abelian) category of sheaves of $\\mathcal O$-modules. Note that map of ringed space $f: X \\to Y$ furnishes a functor \\(f_\\ast : \\operatorname{Mod} \\mathcal O_X \\to \\operatorname{Mod} \\mathcal O_Y\\) . The inverse image of a module is, in general, not a module. Definition. The pullback of an $\\mathcal O_Y$ module $\\mathcal N$ is \\(f^\\ast \\mathcal N := f^{-1} \\mathcal N \\otimes_{f^{-1}\\mathcal O_Y} \\mathcal O_X\\) . Proposition. We have an adjunction $f^\\ast \\vdash f_\\ast$ on sheaves of modules. Spectra of commutative rings . Now we need our local models built from commutative rings. Definition. Let \\(\\operatorname{Spec} R := \\lbrace \\mathfrak p \\lneq R \\mid \\mathfrak p \\text{ is prime} \\rbrace\\) and declare subset closed if it is of the form \\(V(J) := \\lbrace \\mathfrak p \\mid J \\leq \\mathfrak p \\rbrace\\) for some ideal $J \\leq R$. This topological space is the (prime) spectrum of $R$ with the Zariski topology. Of course, one needs to check that we actually have a topology. But, we suppress that check. Given a $a \\in R$, we have a principal open \\(U_a := V(a)^c\\) . Lemma. The open sets $U_a$ for $a \\in R$ form a basis for the Zariki topology. Proof. (Expand to view) Take any open set $V(J)^c$ and pick $a \\in J \\neq 0$. Then $$ U_a \\subseteq V(J) $$ &#9632; . Lemma. We have an isomorphism of (locally) ringed spaces \\(\\operatorname{Spec} R_a \\to U_a\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) The isomorphism is given by $$ \\mathfrak{p} \\mapsto i^{-1}\\mathfrak{p} $$ for the canonical map $i: R \\to R_a$. We suppress further details. &#9632; . In general, not all open subsets of $\\operatorname{Spec} R$ will be of the form $\\operatorname{Spec} S$ for some ring $S$ but we have the following. Lemma. We have an isomorphism \\(V(J) \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} R/J\\) . Proof. (Expand to view) For the quotient map $\\pi: R \\to R/J$ we get $$ \\pi^{-1} : \\operatorname{Spec} R/J \\to \\operatorname{Spec} R $$ whose image is $V(J)$. &#9632; . We need a sheaf of rings on $\\operatorname{Spec} R$. Definition. The sheaf of regular functions on $\\operatorname{Spec} R$ is the unique sheaf such that \\(\\mathcal O(U_a) = R_a\\) and for $U_a \\subset U_b$ the restriction \\(R_b \\to R_a\\) is the localization map. Note that if $U_a \\subseteq U_b$ then $V(b) \\subset V(a)$. So for any prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ with $(b) \\leq \\mathfrak{p}$ we have $(a) \\leq \\mathfrak{p}$. One can see this implies that $(a) \\leq (b)$ so $a = bc$ giving the map \\(R_b \\to R_a\\) . We can boost this definition to apply to $R$-modules. Given an $R$-module $M$, we let $\\widetilde{M}$ be the sheaf with \\(\\widetilde{M}(U_a) = M_a\\) with localization as the restriction maps as before. We say locally ringed space $X$ is affine if \\(X \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} R\\) Let $\\operatorname{Aff}$ denote the full category of affine locally ringed spaces. We will not prove the following result but it is necessary for the utility of the next definition. Proposition. The functor \\(\\begin{aligned} \\Gamma : \\operatorname{Aff}^{op} &amp; \\to \\operatorname{CRing} \\\\ X &amp; \\mapsto \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal O_X) \\end{aligned}\\) is an equivalence whose inverse is taking the spectrum. Definition. A locally ringed space is a scheme if it is locally affine. For a scheme $X$, an $\\mathcal O_X$-module $\\mathcal F$ is quasi-coherent if for each $x \\in X$ there is affine open $x \\in U = \\operatorname{Spec} R$ with $\\mathcal F|_U \\cong \\widetilde{M}$ for an $R$-module $M$. A quasi-coherent sheaf is coherent if it is locally finitely-presented. We denote the categories by $\\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ and $\\operatorname{coh} X$. Lemma. Let $X=\\operatorname{Spec} R$ be affine. The functor \\(\\begin{aligned} \\Gamma : \\operatorname{Qcoh} X &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Mod} R \\\\ \\mathcal F &amp; \\mapsto \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F) \\end{aligned}\\) is an equivalence whose inverse is \\(M \\mapsto \\widetilde{M}\\) . Lemma. The category $\\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ is an abelian subcategory of $\\operatorname{Mod} \\mathcal O_X$. Under some conditions which we will discuss later, $\\operatorname{coh} X$ is an abelian subcategory. The main actors for the remainder of the term are the following categories. Definition. Let $X$ be a scheme. The derived category of $X$ is $D(\\operatorname{Qcoh} X)$. In the case that $\\operatorname{coh} X$ is abelian, the bounded derived category of $X$ $D^b(\\operatorname{coh} X)$ is the full subcategory of $D(\\operatorname{Qcoh} X)$ consisting of complexes $\\mathcal F$ with bounded and coherent cohomology sheaves. Example. Let $k$ be a field. The simplest affine schemes are \\(\\mathbb{A}^n_k := \\operatorname{Spec} k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]\\) . For each point $p \\in k^n$, we have a maximal ideal \\((x_1 - p_1,\\ldots,x_n - p_n)\\) so we have an inclusion \\(k^n \\subset \\mathbb{A}^n_k\\) The induced topology on $k^n$ the one where the closed sets are the zero loci of polynomials. In the case $k= \\mathbb{R}$ or $k = \\mathbb{C}$ we can compare to the Euclidean (metric) topology. For the Zariski topology, any two open subsets intersect and any open subset is dense. This is not the case for Euclidean topology. In general, the points from $k^n$ are not all the points of $\\mathbb{A}^n_k$. We also have points corresponding to each prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ and if $\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathfrak{p}^\\prime$ we have \\(\\mathfrak{p} \\in \\overline{\\lbrace \\mathfrak{p}^\\prime \\rbrace}\\) and vice-versa. Thus, points in the Zariski topology are, in general, not closed and are closed only when they are maximal ideals. Even in the case of $\\mathbb{R}[x]$ we can have maximal ideals not generated by linear polynomials, $(x^2+1)$. Given a finitely-generated $k$-algebra $R$, we can write \\(R \\cong k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/I\\) for some ideal $I$. Then, we can use the zero locus of $I$ in $k^n$ to think about $\\operatorname{Spec} R$. Next, we will talk about central global examples: projective spaces. ",

    "title": "Projective spaces as schemes",
    "content": "The primary example of a non-affine scheme is a projective space. We will describe the scheme and in the process obtain an understanding of its category of quasi-coherent sheaves. We start in general with a ($\\mathbb{Z}$-) graded ring. Definition. A ring $R$ is $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded if there is a decomposition of $R$ \\(R = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}}^{\\infty} R_i\\) as an abelian group such that \\(R_i R_j \\subseteq R_{i+j}\\) $R_i$ is called the i-th graded piece of $R$. An element $r \\in R_i$ is homogeneous of degree i. We will often be concerned with case that $R_i = 0$ for $i &gt; 0$. Here we will say that $R$ is $\\mathbb{N}$-graded. In the $\\mathbb{N}$-graded case, we have a canonical maximal ideal \\(R_+ := \\bigoplus_{i &gt; 0} R_i\\) Often $R_+$ is called the irrelevant ideal. The primary example of a graded ring is the polynomial ring $k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]$ where we grade each $x_i$ as $a_i$ for some choice and extend multiplicatively. The standard grading is $a_i = 1$ for each $i$. A graded $R$-module $M$ is an $R$-module with \\(M = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} M_i\\) such that \\(R_i M_j \\subseteq M_{i+j}\\) . An ideal $I$ is homogeneous if \\(I = \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} I \\cap R_i\\) is a graded module. Definition. Let $R$ be a $\\mathbb{N}$-graded ring. Then \\(\\operatorname{Proj} R := \\lbrace \\mathfrak p \\not \\supseteq R_+ \\mid \\mathfrak{p} \\text{ is homogenous and prime} \\rbrace\\) with the topology whose closed subsets are $V(J)$ for homogeneous $J$. Example. For $R = k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]$ with the standard grading we write \\(\\mathbb{P}_k^n := \\operatorname{Proj} R\\) and call it n-dimensional projective space. For homogeneous elements $a \\in R$, we have the corresponding principal opens $U_a$. Pick element $a \\in R_i$ with $i &gt; 0$. Then, we get a function \\(\\begin{aligned} U_a &amp; \\to \\operatorname{Spec} (R_a)_0 \\\\ \\mathfrak p &amp; \\mapsto (\\mathfrak p R_a)_0 \\end{aligned}\\) . Lemma. This is well-defined and a homeomorphism. We equip $\\operatorname{Proj} R$ with the sheaf of rings determined by \\(\\mathcal O(U_a) := (R_a)_0\\) for positive degree $a$, plus restriction agreeing with localization as before. Given this, we see $\\operatorname{Proj} R$ is a scheme. Example. Let’s look at $\\mathbb{P}_k^n$. Then, we have the principal opens corresponding to the monomials $x_i$. There \\(k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]_{x_i} = k[x_0,\\ldots,x_i^{\\pm 1}, \\ldots, x_n]\\) To get degree zero elements, we need a rational function $f/x_i^d$ where $f$ has degree $d$. Dividing through by $x_i$, we get \\(f/x_i^d \\in k[x_0/x_i,\\ldots,x_n/x_i]\\) Thus, \\(U_{x_i} \\cong \\mathbb{A}^n_k\\) . Looking at the overlap \\(U_{x_i} \\cap U_{x_j} = U_{x_ix_j}\\) we have the inclusions of graded rings \\(k[x_0,\\ldots,x_i^{\\pm 1},\\ldots,x_n] \\subset k[x_0,\\ldots,x_i^{\\pm 1},\\ldots,x_j^{\\pm 1},\\ldots,x_n] \\supset k[x_0,\\ldots,x_j^{\\pm 1},\\ldots,x_n]\\) . Let’s write $y_l = x_l/x_i$ and $z_l = x_l/x_j$. Then, we have \\(y_j z_i = 1\\) We have \\(U_{x_i} \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} k[y_0,\\ldots,\\hat{y_i},\\ldots,y_n]\\) and \\(U_{x_j} \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} k[z_0,\\ldots,\\hat{z_j},\\ldots,z_n]\\) In the first set of coordinates, \\(U_{x_i} \\cap U_{x_j} \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} k[y_0,\\ldots,\\hat{y_i},\\ldots,y_n]_{y_j}\\) while in the second \\(U_{x_i} \\cap U_{x_j} \\cong \\operatorname{Spec} k[z_0,\\ldots,\\hat{z_j},\\ldots,z_n]_{z_i}\\) Changing from one set of coordinates to another is an isomorphism on $U_{x_i} \\cap U_{x_j}$ which can be described explicitly by \\(y_l z_i = z_l\\) . One can extract these charts and their overlap maps as gluing data for the scheme $\\mathbb{P}_k^n$. We won’t talk about this in general but it is another useful way to think of schemes - as glued from affine schemes. Let’s note that $\\mathbb{P}_k^n$ cannot be an affine scheme. Suppose we have $s \\in \\Gamma(\\mathbb{P}^k,\\mathcal O)$. Then, we get \\(s|_{U_{x_i}} \\in k[x_0/x_i,\\ldots,x_n/x_i]\\) for each $i$. Thus, \\(s \\in \\bigcap_{i=0}^n k[x_0/x_i,\\ldots,x_n/x_i] = k\\) We know that if $X$ is affine then \\(X \\cong \\operatorname{Spec}(\\Gamma(X,\\mathcal O))\\) It is clear that \\(\\mathbb{P}_k^n \\neq \\operatorname{Spec} k\\) for $n &gt; 0$. (We have a lot more points.) . Quasi-coherent sheaves and graded modules . Next, for a graded $R$-module $M$, we get a quasi-coherent sheaf $\\widetilde{M}$ by \\(\\widetilde{M}(U_a) := (M_a)_0\\) . This produces an exact functor \\(\\widetilde{(-)} : \\operatorname{GrMod} R \\to \\operatorname{Qcoh} (\\operatorname{Proj} R)\\) . The category of graded modules admits more operations than ungraded modules. In particular, we have grading twists \\(M(i)_j = M_{i+j}\\) analogous to shifts of complexes. We have defined \\(\\mathcal O := \\widetilde{R}\\) and we set \\(\\mathcal O(i) := \\widetilde{R(i)}\\) for each $i \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Lemma. The functor $\\widetilde{(-)}$ commutates with forming tensor products: \\(\\widetilde{M \\otimes_R N} \\cong \\widetilde{M} \\otimes_{\\mathcal O} \\widetilde{N}\\) . Definition. Given a quasi-coherent sheaf $\\mathcal F$ on $\\operatorname{Proj} R$, its i-th twist is \\(\\mathcal F(i) := \\mathcal F \\otimes_{\\mathcal O} \\mathcal O(i)\\) . Combining twists with global sections gives us a way to produce a graded module from a quasi-coherent sheaf. Let \\(\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal F) := \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\Gamma(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal F(i))\\) Lemma. Evaluation at $1$ is an isomorphism \\(\\operatorname{Hom}_{\\mathcal O}(\\mathcal O, \\mathcal F) \\to \\Gamma(X,\\mathcal F)\\) . Thus we can view \\(\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal F) := \\bigoplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\operatorname{Hom}(\\mathcal O, \\mathcal F (i))\\) Using the isomorphism \\(\\mathcal O(i) \\otimes_{\\mathcal O} \\mathcal O(j) \\cong \\mathcal O(i+j)\\) $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal O)$ acquires a natural ring structure. Moreover, given a $r \\in R_i$, we get \\(r : R \\to R(i)\\) in $\\operatorname{GrMod} R$. Applying $\\widetilde{(-)}$ and then $\\Gamma$ gives a map \\(R \\to \\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal O)\\) which is homomorphism of graded rings. For each $\\mathcal F$, $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal F)$ naturally is a $\\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R, \\mathcal O)$-module. Thus, is a graded $R$-module. Proposition. We have an adjunction \\(\\widetilde{(-)} \\vdash \\tilde{\\Gamma}(\\operatorname{Proj} R,-)\\) . We will revisit this at the start of the next semester. But for now, let’s note that this adjunction in general is not coming from an equivalence. Example. Let $R = k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]$ with its standard grading and take \\(k := k[x_0,\\ldots,x_n]/(x_0,\\ldots,x_n)\\) as a graded module. Then \\(\\widetilde{k}(U_{x_i}) = (k_{x_i})_0\\) As $x_i$ acts by zero on $k$ and must be an isomorphism, we have \\((k_{x_i})_0 = 0\\) for each $i$. Thus, \\(\\widetilde{k} = 0\\) giving an nonzero object which is mapped to $0$. More generally, we say that $M$ is $R_+$-torsion if for each $m \\in M$ there is some $l &gt; 0$ with \\((R_+)^l m = 0\\) The full subcategory of $R_+$-torsion modules is denoted by $\\operatorname{Tors}_{R_+}(R)$ or simply $\\operatorname{Tors}(R)$ if the context is clear. The same argument as in the example of $\\mathbb{P}_k^n$ shows that \\(\\widetilde{M} = 0\\) for any $M \\in \\operatorname{Tors}(R)$. In fact, we will see that $\\operatorname{Qcoh}(X)$ is the quotient of $\\operatorname{GrMod} R$ by the subcategory $\\operatorname{Tors}(R)$. ",

You should submit a request in writing (email is acceptable) stating the dates of the anticipated absence, explaining the reason for absence, providing supporting documentation as required above, and including any request for make-up work. You should submit this request no later than the end of the second week of regularly scheduled classes in a full fall or spring semester term and within twice the length of the drop/add period for any other term. If regularly attending class becomes difficult for any reason, please contact me to discuss the issue. In accordance with university policy, a grade penalty of 10% may be imposed if a student has unexcused absensces exceeding 5% of the total number of courses. For this course, that means missing TWO courses without excuse. All absences due to documented illness or quarantine will be excused, and no grade penalty will be assessed for missing classes for this reason. If you experience COVID-19 symptoms, please stay home, contact the COVID-19 Student Health Services (SHS) nurse line (803-576-8511), complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and select the option allowing the Student Ombuds to contact your professors. When talking with the SHS nurse, be sure to ask for documentation of the consult as you will need this to document why you missed class. You will also use the COVID-19 Student Report Form if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or if you have been ordered to quarantine because of close contact with a person who was COVID-19 positive. In each of these situations you will be provided appropriate documentation that can be shared through the Student Report Form. ",

    "title": "COVID Policies",
    "content": "As of 8/17/2021, UofSC requires face coverings, including in this class. For more information on this semester’s COVID policies see the guidance from the Provost. I strongly encourage getting vaccinated. I encourage physical distancing. While not always possible, I will strive to keep everyone at least three feet apart, even when working in groups, which we will do regularly. If you feel uncomfortable with group work in my class, please come talk with me and I don’t mind letting you work independently at all. I have been requested to keep a seating chart. I have been urged to keep this seating chart for contact tracing purposes and will do my best to abide by the University policy. Questions You May Have . What if I get sick with COVID? Two things have to occur: Isolation: Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are released from isolation when a medical professional has determined, based on the current CDC and DHEC guidelines, that they have recovered. Currently, these guidelines include being fever-free for at least 24 hours and at least 10 days from their first symptom or positive test if they are asymptomatic. Quarantine: Unvaccinated students who are deemed a close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case will be quarantined for 7-14 days from their last contact with the infected individual. More specifically, students who test negative on day 5, 6, or 7 can leave quarantine after 7 full days; individuals who did not test but remain asymptomatic can leave after 10 full days. Individuals who are symptomatic or have other health concerns may be advised to remain under quarantine for 14 days.  . What is the attendance policy if I get COVID? In brief, I must provide make-up course work including content and assignments when students have excused absences which include (but are not limited to) being in quarantine or isolation, religious holidays, medical conditions related to pregnancy, and military duty. However, recorded classes and hybrid/online options are not required and should not be expected. All excused absences must have documentation. See syllabus for further attendance policies. How will the Dr. Ballard know if I am absent due to quarantine or isolation? COVID-19 related absences must be document through the Student Ombudsman.  Students who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or have been exposed and require quarantining should complete the COVID-19 Student Report Form and instructors should request this form in order to excuse the absence.  . Can I inquire about classmates condition with COVID? Sadly, not with me. These are health issues and the information is protected by state and federal law. If an individual student has questions about whether they should quarantine or believe that they have been in close contact, have them reach out to the COVID Phone Bank (803-576-8511). Would we ever change to go online if too many people are sick? Only in the rare instance that 30% or more of students have documented excused absences may I take the course online. This is not to be expected and very complicated according to the current policies. What if Dr. Ballard gets sick with COVID? I have been fully vaccinated and breakthrough infection symptoms most often resemble the common cold. In the event of a breakthrough infection, I will enter the self-isolation period and the course will switch modality to synchronous online temporarily. In the rare circumstance I am unable to teach remotely, a substitute instructor will take over the course. ",

Appropriate language and restraint from verbal attacks upon those whose perspectives differ from your own is a minimum requirement. Courtesy and kindness is the norm for those who participate in the class. Mistakes, in particular during the running phase, are expected and natural. Mistakes are how learning happens.

Teams is a way for you to share your ideas and learning with your colleagues in this class. We do this as colleagues in learning, and the online space is meant to be a safe and respectful environment for us to conduct these discussions. Some general netiquette rules: . | Treat one another with respect. It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings. This is considered “shouting” and is seen as impolite or aggressive. | Begin emails with a proper salutation (Examples: Dr. Name; Ms. Name; Hello Professor Name; Good afternoon Mr. Name). Starting an email without a salutation or a simple “Hey” is not appropriate. | When sending an email, please include a detailed subject line. Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating. Profanity should be avoided. | Re-Read, think, and edit your message before you click “Send/Submit/Post.” . | Please remember when posting to be respectful and courteous to your colleagues, and limit your communication to topics of this course and the assignments. | .

    "content": "Matthew Ballard . ballard@math.sc.edu . Schedule an appointment . I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of South Carolina. I have been teaching mathematics for almost two decades and have guided nearly 1000 students from all levels through math courses. A mindset focused on growth is essential for learning mathematics. Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. For a brief introduction to my mentees see the mentoring page. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, funding from UofSC, and the Southeastern Conference. For more information about me, see my CV. For a research summary and a list of my papers, take a look at my research page. I regularly organize mathematical events, even virtual ones. For the full list of events, see the organizing page. If you are interested in participating, contact me. ",
