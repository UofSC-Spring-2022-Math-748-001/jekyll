## A glimpse of the future

We step into the future of the class and attempt to explain the terminology 
of kernels and integral transformations. 

Let $p: X \to S$ be a scheme over a base scheme $B$. Here you should 
think $X$ and $B$ are "locally look like rings" but are 
have global geometry. 

The replacement for modules over rings will be the category of quasi-coherent 
sheaves $\operatorname{Qcoh} X$ on $X$. Like modules over a ring, we can 
tensor two such over the structure sheaf $\mathcal O_X$ of $X$. 

Given a map $f: X \to Y$ of 
schemes over $B$, we get a few operations on quasi-coherent sheaves. 

The most familiar one, from discussion so far, is pullback 
$$
    f^\ast : \operatorname{Qcoh} Y \to \operatorname{Qcoh} X
$$
Locally $f$ corresponds to a map of rings 
$$
    \phi : R \to S 
$$
and $f^\ast$ is $S \otimes_R -$. 

The other one is pushforward 
$$
    f_\ast : \operatorname{Qcoh} X \to \operatorname{Qcoh} Y
$$
If $X$ and $Y$ were just rings (ie affine schemes), then $f_\ast$ 
would be the restriction of scalars along the ring homomorphism $\phi$. 

In general, $f_\ast$ is more global. Indeed, it can viewed as akin 
to integration along the fibers of the map $f: X \to Y$. 

We still have the adjunction 
$$
    f^\ast \vdash f_\ast 
$$

The globalization of tensoring with a bimodule comes from take a 
quasi-coherent sheaf $\mathcal K$ on the fiber product $X \times_B Y$. 
The fiber product has two maps 
$$
    p : X \times_B Y \to X 
$$
and 
$$
    q : X \times_B Y \to Y
$$

From this we get a functor 
$$
    \begin{aligned}
        \Phi_{\mathcal K} : D(\operatorname{Qcoh} X) & \to D(\operatorname{Qcoh} Y) \\
        \mathcal E & \mapsto \mathbf{R}q_\ast 
        \left( \mathcal K \overset{\mathbf{L}}{\otimes} \mathbf{L}p^\ast \mathcal E \right)
    \end{aligned}
$$
called an _integral transform_ with kernel $\mathcal K$. 

For affine schemes, this is, up to equivalence, the functor 
$$
    E \mapsto M \otimes_R E
$$

The language is motivated by the analogy with integral transformations of 
functions: 
$$
    e(x) \mapsto \int_X k(x,y)e(x) \ dx 
$$

Before we dive in the details sufficient to start working with such things, 
we want to introduce some common concepts used for such $D(X)$ and for which 
we have enough tools to understand.
